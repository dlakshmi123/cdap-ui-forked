=================================================
Transformations: StructuredRecordToGenericRecord 
=================================================

.. rubric:: Description

Transforms a StructuredRecord into an Avro GenericRecord. StructuredRecord is
the Java class that all built-in plugins work with. Most StructuredRecords can be
directly converted to a GenericRecord. An exception is if the StructuredRecord contains
a map field with keys that are not of type 'string'.

.. rubric:: Use Case

The transform is used whenever you need to use an Avro GenericRecord.
For example, if you have a custom sink that accepts as input GenericRecords, you will use this transform
right before the sink.

.. rubric:: Properties

The transform does not take any properties.

.. rubric:: Example

::

  {
    "name": "StructuredRecordToGenericRecord",
    "properties": { }
  }
