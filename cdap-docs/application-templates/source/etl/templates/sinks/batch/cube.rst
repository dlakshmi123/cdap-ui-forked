==================
Sinks: Batch: Cube 
==================

.. rubric:: Description

Batch sink that writes to a Cube dataset.

BatchCubeSink takes a StructuredRecord in, maps it to a CubeFact, and writes it to
the Cube dataset identified by the name property.

If the Cube dataset does not exist, it will be created using properties provided with this
sink.

.. rubric:: Use Case

A BatchCubeSink is used to write data into a Cube from batch-enabled data sources to allow further data analysis.
For example, you can periodically upload data from a PartitionedFileSet into a Cube to perform complex
data queries across multiple dimensions and aggregated measurements.

.. rubric:: Properties

**name:** Name of the Cube dataset. If the Cube does not already exist, one will be created.

**dataset.cube.resolutions:** Aggregation resolutions to be used if a new Cube dataset needs to be created.
See `Cube dataset configuration details <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/current/en/developers-manual/building-blocks/datasets/cube.html#cube-configuration>`__ for more information.

**dataset.cube.properties:** Provides any dataset properties to be used if a new Cube dataset
needs to be created; provided as a JSON Map. For example, if aggregations are desired on fields 'abc' and 'xyz', the
property should have the value: {"dataset.cube.aggregation.agg1.dimensions":"abc", "dataset.cube.aggregation.agg2.dimensions":"xyz"}.
See `Cube dataset configuration details <http://docs.cask.co/cdap/current/en/developers-manual/building-blocks/datasets/cube.html#cube-configuration>`__ for more information.

**cubeFact.timestamp.field:** Name of the StructuredRecord field that contains the timestamp to be used in
the CubeFact. If not provided, the current time of the record processing will be used as the CubeFact timestamp.

Name of the StructuredRecord's field that contains timestamp to be used in CubeFact.
If not provided, the current time of the record processing will be used as CubeFact timestamp.

**cubeFact.timestamp.format:** Format of the value of timestamp field; example: "HH:mm:ss" (used if
cubeFact.timestamp.field is provided).

**cubeFact.measurements:** Measurements to be extracted from StructuredRecord to be used in CubeFact.
Provide properties as a JSON Map. For example, to use the 'price' field as a measurement of type gauge,
and the 'quantity' field as a measurement of type counter, the property should have the value:
{"cubeFact.measurement.price":"GAUGE", "cubeFact.measurement.quantity":"COUNTER"}.

.. rubric:: Example

This configuration specifies writing data into a Cube dataset named "myCube"; it provides dataset properties
(dataset.*) for creating a new dataset, if one with the given name doesn't exist; it then configures measurements to aggregate and specifies the timestamp format for facts being written into the Cube::

    {
        "name": "myCube",
        "dataset.cube.resolutions": "1,60,3600",
        "dataset.cube.properties": {
          "dataset.cube.aggregation.byName.dimensions": "name",
          "dataset.cube.aggregation.byNameByZip.dimensions": "name,zip",
        },
        "cubeFact.timestamp.field": "ts",
        "cubeFact.timestamp.format": "MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss",
        "cubeFact.measurements": {
          "cubeFact.measurement.price": "GAUGE"
          "cubeFact.measurement.quantity": "COUNTER"
        }
    }

Once the data is there, you could run queries using an AbstractCubeHttpHandler. (You'd need to deploy an application
containing a service using it.) A sample query::

    {
        "aggregation": "byName",
        "startTs": 1323370200,
        "endTs":   1523398198,
        "measurements": {"price": "MAX"},
        "resolution": 1,
        "dimensionValues": {},
        "groupByDimensions": ["name"],
        "limit": 1000
    }

Example result::

    [
        {
            "measureName": "price",
            "dimensionValues": {
                "name": "user1"
            },
            "timeValues": [
                {
                    "timestamp": 1323370201,
                    "value": 100
                },
                {
                    "timestamp": 1323370210,
                    "value": 360
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "measureName": "price",
            "dimensionValues": {
                "name": "user2"
            },
            "timeValues": [
                {
                    "timestamp": 1323370201,
                    "value": 200
                },
                {
                    "timestamp": 1323370210,
                    "value": 160
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
