Starting CDAP Services
======================

.. highlight:: console

When all the packages and dependencies have been installed, and the configuration
parameters set, you can start the services on each of the CDAP boxes by running the
command::

  $ for i in `ls /etc/init.d/ | grep cdap` ; do sudo service $i start ; done

When all the services have completed starting, the CDAP UI should then be
accessible through a browser at port ``9999``. 

The URL will be ``http://<host>:9999`` where ``<host>`` is the IP address of
one of the machines where you installed the packages and started the services.
