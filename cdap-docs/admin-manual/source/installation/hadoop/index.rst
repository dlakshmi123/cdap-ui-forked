This section is to help you install the Cask Data Application Platform (CDAP) on Hadoop
systems, either generic Apache Hadoop distributions, CDH clusters *not* managed with
Cloudera Manager, or HDP clusters *not* managed with Ambari.

For other distributions, managers, or formats:

- For Cloudera Manager, follow :ref:`these instructions <cloudera-index>`.
- For Apache Ambari, follow :ref:`these instructions <ambari-index>`.
- For MapR, follow :ref:`these instructions <mapr-index>`.
- For the CDAP Standalone SDK, follow :ref:`these instructions <standalone-index>`. *(Developers' Manual)*

These instructions cover the steps to install CDAP on Hadoop systems:

.. |installation| replace:: **Installation:**

- |installation|_ Covers the system, network, and software requirements, packaging
  options, and instructions for installation of the CDAP components so they work with your
  existing Hadoop cluster.
- |configuration|_ Covers the configuration options of the CDAP installation.
- |verification|_ Starting the services, (optionally) making CDAP
