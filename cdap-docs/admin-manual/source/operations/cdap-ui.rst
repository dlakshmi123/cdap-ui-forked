Across the top, are three buttons: *Development*, *Operations*, and *Management*. These

In the upper-left is a menu for setting the namespace. In the upper-right is a menu
with access to the main Cask Website, Support, and logging out.

On the **Development** page, datasets and applications are displayed. The **Operations** page
gives you views of current system and user metrics, with customizable dashboards. The
**Management** page provides features and controls for administering the CDAP installation.
