Master Service Logging Configuration
====================================

:term:`Master Services <master services>` use ``logback-container.xml``, packaged with the CDAP distribution,
for logging configuration. This logback does log rotation once a day at midnight and expires logs older than
14 days. Changes can be made to ``logback-container.xml``, and the ``cdap-master`` process will need to be restarted
for the modified logback to take effect.
