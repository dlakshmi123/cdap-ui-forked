To use the *TimeFilter*, input ``timefilter``. The TimeFilter assumes that it is
reading in files with the File log naming convention of *YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-SS-Tag*.
The TimeFilter reads in files from the previous hour if the field ``timeTable`` is
left blank. If it's currently *2015-06-16-15* (June 16th 2015, 3pm), it will read
in files that contain *2015-06-16-14* in the filename. If the field ``timeTable`` is
present, then it will read in files that have not yet been read.
