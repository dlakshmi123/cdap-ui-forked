========================================
Starting and Stopping CDAP Local Sandbox
========================================

.. this file is included in others; any titles need to be +

.. _start-stop-cdap:

.. highlight:: console

Use the ``cdap sandbox`` script (or, if you are using Windows, use ``cdap.bat sandbox``)
to start and stop the CDAP Local Sandbox (the location will vary depending on where the
CDAP Local Sandbox is installed):

.. tabbed-parsed-literal::

    $ cd cdap-sandbox-|version|
    $ ./bin/cdap sandbox start
    . . .
    $ ./bin/cdap sandbox stop


.. include:: /_includes/windows-note.txt

Note that starting CDAP is not necessary if you use either the Virtual Machine or the
Docker image, as they both start the CDAP Local Sandbox automatically on startup.

Once CDAP is started successfully, in a web browser you will be able to see the CDAP UI
running at :cdap-ui:`http://localhost:11011/ <>`, where you can deploy example
applications and interact with CDAP.

Note that in the case of the Docker container running inside a Virtual Machine (as on
either Mac OS X or Microsoft Windows), you will need to substitute the Docker VM's IP
address for ``localhost`` in the web browser address bar.
