Workflows
============================================

**Workflows** are used to automate the execution of a series of :ref:`MapReduce
<mapreduce>`, :ref:`Spark <spark>` or :ref:`custom actions <workflow-custom-actions>`. It
allows for both sequential and :ref:`parallel execution <workflow_parallel>` of programs.

The workflow system allows specifying, executing, scheduling, and monitoring complex
series of jobs and tasks in CDAP. The system can manage thousand of workflows and maintain
millions of historic workflow logs. 

Overview
========

A Workflow is given a sequence of programs that follow each other, with an optional
schedule to run the Workflow periodically. Upon successful execution of a program, the
control is transferred to the next program in the sequence until the last program in the
sequence is executed. Upon failure, the execution is stopped at the failed program and no
subsequent programs in the sequence are executed.

To execute MapReduce or Spark programs in a Workflow, you will need to add them in your
application along with the Workflow. You can optionally add a :ref:`Schedule <schedules>` 
(such as a `crontab schedule 
<../../reference-manual/javadocs/co/cask/cdap/api/app/AbstractApplication.html#scheduleWorkflow(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String)>`__)
to the Workflow::

  public void configure() {
    ...
    addMapReduce(new MyMapReduce());
    addMapReduce(new AnotherMapReduce());
    addSpark(new MySpark());
    addWorkflow(new MyWorkflow());
    scheduleWorkflow(Schedules.createTimeSchedule("FiveHourSchedule", 
                                                  "Schedule running every 5 hours", 
                                                  "0 */5 * * *"),
                     "MyWorkflow");
    ...
  }

You'll then extend the ``AbstractWorkflow`` class and implement the ``configure()``
method. Inside ``configure``, you can add multiple MapReduce, Spark programs or custom
actions to the Workflow. The programs will be executed in the order they are specified in
the ``configure`` method::

  public static class MyWorkflow extends AbstractWorkflow {

    @Override
    public void configure() {
        setName("MyWorkflow");
        setDescription("MyWorkflow description");
        addMapReduce("MyMapReduce");
        addSpark("MySpark");
        addMapReduce("AnotherMapReduce");
        addAction(new MyAction());
    }
  }

In this example, the ``MyWorkflow`` will be executed every 5 hours. During each execution
of the Workflow, the ``MyMapReduce``, ``MySpark``, and ``AnotherMapReduce`` programs and
the ``MyAction`` custom action will be executed in order.

.. _workflow-custom-actions:

Workflow Custom Action
----------------------
In addition to MapReduce and Spark programs, Workflow can also execute custom actions.
Custom actions are implemented in Java and can perform tasks such as sending an email. To
define a custom action, you will need to extend the ``AbstractWorkflowAction`` and
implement the ``run()`` method::

  public static class MyAction extends AbstractWorkflowAction {

    @Override
    public void run() {
      // your code goes here
    }
  }

The custom action then can be added to the Workflow using the ``addAction()`` method as
shown above.

Concurrent Workflows
--------------------
By default, a Workflow runs sequentially. Multiple instances of a Workflow can be run
concurrently. To enable concurrent runs for a Workflow, set its runtime argument
``concurrent.runs.enabled`` to ``true``.

.. _workflow_parallel:

Parallelizing Workflow Execution
================================

The control flow of a Workflow can be described as a directed, acyclic graph of actions.
To be more precise, we require that it be a series-parallel graph. This is a graph with a
single start node and a single finish node. In between, execution can fork into concurrent
branches, but the graph may not have cycles. Every action can be a batch job or a custom
action (implemented in Java; for example, making a REST call to an external system).

For example, a simple control flow could be computing user and product profiles from
purchase events. After the start, a batch job could start that joins the events with the
product catalog. After that, execution could continue with a fork, and with two batch jobs
running in parallel: one computing product profiles; while the other computes user
profiles. When they are both done, execution is joined and continues with a custom action
to upload the computed profiles to a serving system, after which the control flow
terminates:

Forks and Joins
---------------

To create such a Workflow, you provide a series of *forks* and *joins* in your Workflow
specification, following these rules:

- Where your control flow initially splits, you place a ``fork`` method. 
- Every time your control flow splits, you add additional ``fork`` methods. 
- Every point where you have either a program or an action, you add a ``addMapReduce``,
  ``addSpark``, or ``addAction`` method. 
- To show each fork, use a ``also`` method to separate the different branches of the
  control flow. 
- Where your control flow reconnects, you add a ``join`` method to indicate. 
- The control flow always concludes with a ``join`` method.

The application shown above could be coded (assuming the other classes referred to exist) as::

  public class ParallelizedWorkflow extends AbstractWorkflow {

    @Override
    public void configure() {
      setName("ParallelizedWorkflow");
      setDescription("Demonstration of parallelizing execution of a Workflow");
      
      addMapReduce("JoinWithCatalogMR");
    
      fork()
        .addMapReduce("BuildProductProfileMR")
      .also()
        .addMapReduce("BuildUserProfileMR")
      .join();
      
      addAction(new UploadProfilesCA());
    }
  }

Provided that the control flow does not have cycles or the joining of any branches that do
not originate from the same fork, flows of different complexity can be created using these
rules and methods.

More complicated structures can be created using ``fork``. To add another MapReduce
that runs in parallel to the entire process described above, you could use code such as::

  public class ComplexParallelizedWorkflow extends AbstractWorkflow {

    @Override
    public void configure() {
      setName("ComplexParallelizedWorkflow");
      setDescription("Demonstration of parallelized execution using a complex fork in a Workflow");

      fork()
        .addMapReduce("JoinWithCatalogMR")
        .fork()
          .addMapReduce("BuildProductProfileMR")
        .also()
          .addMapReduce("BuildUserProfileMR")
        .join()
          .addAction(new UploadProfilesCA())
      .also()
        .addMapReduce("LogMonitoringMR")
      .join();
    }
  }
