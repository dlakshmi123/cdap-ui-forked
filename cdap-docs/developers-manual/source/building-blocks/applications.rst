Applications
============================================

.. highlight:: java

An **Application** is a collection of building blocks that read and write data through the data
abstraction layer in CDAP. 

**Applications** are composed from *Programs,* *Services,* and *Schedules*.

Programs include :doc:`Flows <flows-flowlets/index>`, :doc:`MapReduce programs <mapreduce-programs>`,
:doc:`Workflows <workflows>`, :doc:`Spark Programs <spark-programs>`, and :doc:`Workers <workers>` are used to process
data. :doc:`Services <services>` are used to serve data.

**Data abstractions** include :doc:`Streams <streams>` and :doc:`Datasets <datasets/index>`.

.. rubric:: Creating an Application with an Application Specification

To create an Application, implement the ``Application`` interface or subclass from
``AbstractApplication`` class, specifying the Application metadata and declaring and
configuring each of the Application components::

      public class MyApp extends AbstractApplication {
        @Override
        public void configure() {
          setName("myApp");
          setDescription("My Sample Application");
          addStream(new Stream("myAppStream"));
          createDataset("myAppDataset", Table.class);
          addFlow(new MyAppFlow());
          addService(new MyService());
          addMapReduce(new MyMapReduce());
          addWorkflow(new MyAppWorkflow());
        }
      }

Notice that *Streams* are defined using the provided ``Stream`` class, and *Datasets* are
defined by passing a ``Table`` class; both are referenced by name.

Other components are defined using user-written classes that implement correspondent
interfaces and are referenced by passing an object, in addition to being assigned a unique
name.

Names used for *Streams* and *Datasets* need to be unique across the CDAP instance, while
names used for *Programs* and *Services* need to be unique only to the application.

.. rubric:: A Typical CDAP Application

A typical design of a CDAP Application consists of:

- Streams to ingest data into CDAP;
- Flows, consisting of Flowlets linked together, to process the ingested data
  in realtime or batch;
- MapReduce programs, Spark programs, and Workflows for batch processing tasks;
- Workers for processing data in an ad-hoc manner that doesn't fit into real-time or batch paradigms
- Datasets for storage of data, either raw or the processed results; and
- Services for serving data and processed results.

Of course, not all components are required: it depends on the application. A minimal
application could include a Stream, a Flow, a Flowlet, and a Dataset. It's possible a
Stream is not needed, if other methods of bringing in data are used. In the next pages,
we'll look at these components, and their interactions.
