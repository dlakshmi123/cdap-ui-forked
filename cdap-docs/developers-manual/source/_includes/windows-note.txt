**Note:** There is an issue with running Microsoft Windows and using the CDAP Standalone
scripts when ``JAVA_HOME`` is defined as a path with spaces in it. A workaround is to use
a definition of ``JAVA_HOME`` that does not include spaces, such as
``C:\PROGRA~1\Java\jdk1.7.0_79\bin`` or ``C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath``.
