.. rubric:: Introduction

One of the first tasks of actually working with Big Data applications is getting the data in.
As data ingestion is a fundamental issue, and as one tool often does not fit all needs,
we have assembled a set of tools and applications to assist in ingesting data into CDAP:

- Java and Python APIs for controlling and writing to Streams;
- a drop zone for bulk ingestion of files ;
- a File Tailer daemon to tail local files; and
- an Apache Flume Sink implementation for writing events received from a source.
