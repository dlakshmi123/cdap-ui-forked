Data Cleansing
==============

A Cask Data Application Platform (CDAP) example demonstrating incrementally consuming partitions of a partitioned fileset using MapReduce.

Overview
========

This application has a MapReduce which processes records from one partitioned file set into another partitioned file set,
while filtering records that do not match a particular schema.

- The ``DataCleansingService`` writes to the ``rawRecords`` partitioned file set.
- The ``DataCleansingMapReduce`` processes the records, while filtering 'unclean' or invalid records.

Let's look at some of these components, and then run the application and see the results.

The Data Cleansing Application
------------------------------

As in the other :ref:`examples <examples-index>`, the components
of the application are tied together by the class ``DataCleansing``:

.. literalinclude:: /../../../cdap-examples/DataCleansing/src/main/java/co/cask/cdap/examples/datacleansing/DataCleansing.java
   :language: java
   :lines: 27-

Data Storage
------------

- ``rawRecords`` input PartitionedFileSet of the DataCleansingMapReduce, contains any ingested records.
- ``cleanRecords`` output PartitionedFileSet, contains only the filtered records.
- ``consumingState`` stores the state of the DataCleansingMapReduce, such that in each run,
  it processes only new partitions.


DataCleansingService
--------------------

The service allows writing to the 'rawRecords' PartitionedFileSet.
It exposes the following endpoint:

- POST ``/records/raw`` allows for writing to a partition of the 'rawRecords' dataset;

MapReduce over PartitionedFileSet
---------------------------------

``DataCleansingMapReduce`` is a simple MapReduce that reads from the ``rawRecords`` PartitionedFileSet and writes to
the ``cleanRecords`` PartitionedFileSet. The ``beforeSubmit`` method prepares the MapReduce program:

- It uses the ``BatchPartitionConsumer`` to specify the partitions to process as input, in order to only process new
  partitions since its last run.
- It specifies the output partition that is written to, based upon the supplied runtime arguments.

Running the Example
===================

Starting the Service
--------------------

Once the application is deployed:

- Go to the *DataCleansing* `application overview page
  <http://localhost:9999/ns/default/apps/DataCleansing/overview/status>`__,
  click ``DataCleansingService`` to get to the service detail page, then click the *Start* button; or
- From the Standalone CDAP SDK directory, use the Command Line Interface::

    $ cdap-cli.sh start service DataCleansing.DataCleansingService

    Successfully started service 'DataCleansingService' of application 'DataCleansing' with stored runtime arguments '{}'

Ingesting Records
-----------------

Begin by uploading a file containing some newline-separated JSON records into the ``rawRecords`` dataset::

  $ cdap-cli.sh call service DataCleansing.DataCleansingService POST v1/records/raw body:file examples/DataCleansing/resources/person.json

Starting the MapReduce
----------------------

The MapReduce must be started with a runtime argument ``output.partition.key`` in order to specify the output partition of
the ``cleanRecords`` dataset to write to. In this example, we'll simply use ``1`` as the value.

- Go to the *DataCleansing* `application overview page
  <http://localhost:9999/ns/default/apps/DataCleansing/overview/status>`__,
  click ``DataCleansingMapReduce`` to get to the MapReduce detail page, set the runtime
  arguments using ``output.partition.key`` as the key and ``1`` as the value, then click the *Start* button; or
- Use the Command Line Interface::

    $ cdap-cli.sh start mapreduce DataCleansing.DataCleansingMapReduce output.partition.key=1

    Successfully started mapreduce 'DataCleansingMapReduce' of application 'DataCleansing'
    with provided runtime arguments 'output.partition.key=1'

Optionally, to specify a custom schema to match records against, the JSON of the schema can be
specified as an additional runtime argument to the MapReduce with the key 'schema.key'.
Otherwise, the default schema that is matched against the records:

.. literalinclude:: /../../../cdap-examples/DataCleansing/src/main/java/co/cask/cdap/examples/datacleansing/DataCleansingMapReduce.java
    :language: java
    :lines: 108-112

Querying the Results
--------------------

.. highlight:: console

To sample the ``cleanRecords`` PartitionedFileSet execute an explore query using the CDAP CLI::

  $ cdap-cli.sh execute 'SELECT record FROM dataset_cleanRecords where TIME = 1 LIMIT 5'

- Alternatively, go to the *rawRecords* `dataset explore page
  <http://localhost:9999/ns/default/datasets/cleanRecords/overview/explore>`__,
  and execute the query from there.

The records that are not filtered out (those that adhere to the given schema) will be displayed::

  +======================================================================+
  | record: STRING                                                       |
  +======================================================================+
  | {"pid":223986723,"name":"bob","dob":"02-12-1983","zip":"84125"}      |
  | {"pid":001058370,"name":"jill","dob":"12-12-1963","zip":"84125"}     |
  | {"pid":000150018,"name":"wendy","dob":"06-19-1987","zip":"84125"}    |
  | {"pid":013587810,"name":"john","dob":"10-10-1991","zip":"84125"}     |
  | {"pid":811638015,"name":"samantha","dob":"04-20-1965","zip":"84125"} |
  +======================================================================+
  Fetched 5 rows

This process of ingesting records, running the MapReduce job with a different output partition key,
and requesting the filtered data can be repeated. Each time, the MapReduce job will pickup and process
only the newly ingested set of records.

Stopping and Removing the Application
=====================================
Once done, you can stop the application as described above in `Stopping an Application.
<#stopping-an-application>`__ Here is an example-specific description of the steps:

**Stopping the Service**

- Go to the *DataCleansing* `application overview page
  <http://localhost:9999/ns/default/apps/DataCleansing/overview/status>`__,
  click ``DataCleansingService`` to get to the service detail page, then click the *Stop* button; or
- From the Standalone CDAP SDK directory, use the Command Line Interface::

    $ cdap-cli.sh stop service DataCleansing.DataCleansingService

**Removing the Application**

You can now remove the application as described above, `Removing an Application <#removing-an-application>`__, or:

- Go to the *DataCleansing* `application overview page
  <http://localhost:9999/ns/default/apps/DataCleansing/overview/status>`__,
  click the *Actions* menu on the right side and select *Manage* to go to the Management pane for the application,
  then click the *Actions* menu on the right side and select *Delete* to delete the application; or
- From the Standalone CDAP SDK directory, use the Command Line Interface::

    $ cdap-cli.sh delete app DataCleansing
