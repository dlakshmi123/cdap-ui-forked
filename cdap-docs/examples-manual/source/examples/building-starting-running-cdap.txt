Building and Starting
=====================

- You can either build the example (as described in :ref:`Building an Example Application 
  <cdap-building-running-example>`) or use the pre-built JAR file included in the CDAP SDK
  (as described in :ref:`Deploying an Application <cdap-building-running-deploying>`):
  
  .. parsed-literal::
    examples/|example|/target/|example|-|release|.jar
  
- Start CDAP (as described in :ref:`Starting and Stopping CDAP <start-stop-cdap>`). 
- Deploy the application, as described in :ref:`Deploying an Application <cdap-building-running-deploying>`.
- Once the application has been deployed, you can start its components, as described in
  :ref:`Starting an Application <cdap-building-running-starting-application>`, and detailed at the 
  start of `running the example <#running-the-example>`__.
- Once all components are started, `run the example <#running-the-example>`__.
- When finished, you can :ref:`stop <cdap-building-running-stopping>`
  and :ref:`remove the application <cdap-building-running-removing>`.
