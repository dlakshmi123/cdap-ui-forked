Spark K-Means
=============

A Cask Data Application Platform (CDAP) Example Demonstrating Spark.

Overview
=============

This example demonstrates a Spark application performing streaming analysis, computing the centers of points from an
input stream using the K-Means Clustering method.

Data from a sample file is sent to CDAP by the external script *inject-data* to the *pointsStream*. This data is
processed by the ``PointsFlow``, which stores the points coordinates event in its entirety in *points*, an ObjectStore Dataset.

As these entries are created, they are taken up by the *SparkKMeansProgram*, which
goes through the entries, calculates centers and tabulates results in another ObjectStore Dataset, *centers*.

Once the application completes, you can query the *centers* Dataset by using the ``centers`` method of the *CentersProcedure*. It will
send back a JSON-formatted result with the center's coordinates based on the ``index`` parameter.

Let's look at some of these elements, and then run the Application and see the results.

The SparkKMeans Application
------------------------------------------------------------

As in the other `examples <index.html>`__, the components
of the Application are tied together by the class ``SparkKMeansApp``:

.. literalinclude:: /../../../cdap-examples/SparkKMeans/src/main/java/co/cask/cdap/examples/sparkkmeans/SparkKMeansApp.java
   :language: java
   :lines: 48-80

``points`` and ``centers``: ObjectStore Data Storage
------------------------------------------------------------

The raw points data is stored in an ObjectStore Dataset, *points*.
The calculated centers data is stored in a second ObjectStore Dataset, *centers*.

``CentersProcedure``: Procedure
------------------------------------------------------------

This procedure has a ``centers`` method to obtain the center's coordinates of a given index.


Building and Starting
=================================

- You can either build the example (as described `below
  <#building-an-example-application>`__) or use the pre-built JAR file included in the CDAP SDK.
- Start CDAP, deploy and start the application as described below in 
  `Running CDAP Applications`_\ .
  Make sure you start the flow and procedure as described.
- Once the application has been deployed and started, you can `run the example. <#running-the-example>`__

Running CDAP Applications
============================================

.. include:: /../../developers-manual/source/getting-started/building-apps.rst
   :start-line: 9

Running the Example
===================

.. highlight:: console

Injecting Points Data
------------------------------

Run this script to inject points data to the Stream named *pointsStream* in the
``SparkKMeans`` application::

  $ ./bin/inject-data.sh

On Windows::

  > bin\inject-data.bat

Running the Spark program
------------------------------
There are three ways to start the Spark program:

1. Click on the ``SparkKMeansProgram`` in the Application page of the CDAP Console to get to the
   Spark dialogue, then click the *Start* button.

2. Send a query via an HTTP request using the ``curl`` command::

    curl -v -d '{args="3"}' \
      'http://localhost:10000/v2/apps/SparkKMeansProgram/spark/SparkKMeansProgram/start'; echo

   On Windows, a copy of ``curl`` is located in the ``libexec`` directory of the SDK::

    libexec\curl...

3. Use the command::

    $ ./bin/app-manager.sh --action run

   On Windows::

    > bin\app-manager.bat run

Querying the Results
------------------------------

If the Procedure has not already been started, you can start it either through the 
CDAP Console or via an HTTP request using the ``curl`` command::

  curl -v -d 'http://localhost:10000/v2/apps/SparkKMeans/procedures/CentersProcedure/start'
  
There are two ways to query the *centers* ObjectStore using the ``CentersProcedure`` procedure:

1. Send a query via an HTTP request using the ``curl`` command. For example::

     curl -v -d '{"index": "1"}' \
       'http://localhost:10000/v2/apps/SparkKMeans/procedures/CentersProcedure/methods/centers'; echo

   On Windows, a copy of ``curl`` is located in the ``libexec`` directory of the SDK::

     libexec\curl...

2. Type the Procedure method name, ``CentersProcedure``, in the Query page of the CDAP Console.

   #. Click the *Query* button in the left side-bar of the CDAP Console.
   #. Click on the *CentersProcedure* Procedure.
   #. Type ``centers`` in the *Method* text box.
   #. Type the parameters required for this method, a JSON string with the name *index* and
      value of the index "1"::

        { "index" : "1" }

   #. Click the *Execute* button.
   #. The center's coordinates will be displayed in the Console in JSON format. For example::

        "9.1,9.1,9.1"

Stopping the Application
-------------------------------
Once done, you can stop the application as described above in `Stopping an Application. <#stopping-an-application>`__
