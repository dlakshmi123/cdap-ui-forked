**Suspending the Schedule**

The only thing you need to do to stop the application is suspend the schedule.

- Using the CDAP-UI, go to the |application-overview|:

  - click |example-workflow-italic| to get to the workflow detail page, 
  - click on the *More* button in the upper-right to display an additional menu, 
  - click on the *Schedules* menu-item to show the schedule, and then 
  - click the *Pause* button (**| |**) so that the status shows as *suspended*; or
  
..

- From the Standalone CDAP SDK directory, use the Command Line Interface:

  .. container:: highlight

    .. parsed-literal::
      |$| cdap-cli.sh suspend schedule |example|.\ |example-schedule|
      Successfully suspended schedule '|example-schedule|' in app '|example|'
