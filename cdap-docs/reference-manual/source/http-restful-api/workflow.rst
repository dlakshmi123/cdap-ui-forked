Workflow Tokens
===============
This interface supports accessing the value of workflow tokens set during runs of a workflow.
Returned values can be specified for a particular scope, node or key.

Obtaining a Token's Values
--------------------------
To get the values that were put into the workflow token for a particular run, 
usen an HTTP GET request to the query's URL::

  GET <base-url>/namespaces/<namespace>/apps/{app-id}/workflows/{workflow-id}/runs/{run-id}[/nodes/{node-id}]/token
  
The request can (optionally) contain a *node-id* to limit the request to a particular node in workflow.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<namespace>``
     - Namespace ID
   * - ``<app-id>``
     - Name of the application
   * - ``<workflow-id>``
     - Name of the workflow
   * - ``<run-id>``
     - UUID of the workflow run
   * - ``<node-id>``
     - Name of a node in the workflow (optional)
     
.. rubric:: Extending the Request
   
The request can be extended with query parameters:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``scope``
     - *user* (default) returns the token for ``Scope.USER``; *system* returns the token for
       ``Scope.SYSTEM``
   * - ``key``
     - Returns the value for a specified key; if unspecified, returns all keys.


.. rubric:: Comments

If the query was successful, the body will contain the workflow token for a particular workflow
run, such as::

  {
    "key1": [
        {
          "nodeName": "node1", 
          "value": "value1"
        }, {
          "nodeName": "node2",
          "value": "value2"
        }
      ],
    "key2": [
        {
            "nodeName": "node2",
            "value": "v2"
        }
      ]
  }

Workflow Statistics
===================
These requests provide statistics across *successful* runs of a Workflow, in a time
interval, for a succession of runs, or between two specific runs. These requests will help
in detecting which jobs might be responsible for delays or problems.

Statistics of Successful Runs
-----------------------------
This request returns general statistics about all *successful* workflow runs in a particular time interval, 
with an analysis based on a series of (optionally) provided percentiles::

  GET <base-url>/namespaces/<namespace>/apps/<app-id>/workflows/<workflow-id>/statistics?
    start=<start-time>&end=<end-time>&percentile=<percentile-1>&percentile=<percentile-2>...
    
where

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<namespace>``
     - Namespace ID
   * - ``<app-id>``
     - Name of the application
   * - ``<workflow-id>``
     - Name of the workflow
   * - ``<start-time>``
     - Start time of runs (in seconds); default is ``now`` (optional)
   * - ``<end-time>``
     - End time of runs (in seconds); default is ``now-1d`` (optional)
   * - ``<percentile-1>``
     - List of percentiles (each greater than zero and less than 100) to be used for generating statistics;
       if not provided, defaults to 90 (optional)

If the query was successful, the body will contain a JSON structure of statistics.

**Note:** When specifying start and end times, in addition to giving an absolute timestamp
in seconds, you can specify a relative time, using ``now`` minus an increment with units.
Examples: ``now-<n>s``, ``now-<n>m``,  ``now-<n>h``, or ``now-<n>d``.
