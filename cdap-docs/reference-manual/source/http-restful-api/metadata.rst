Metadata HTTP RESTful API
=========================

.. highlight:: console

Use the CDAP Metadata HTTP RESTful API to set, retrieve, and delete the metadata annotations
of applications, datasets, streams, and other entities in CDAP.

Metadata consists of **properties** (a list of key-value pairs) or **tags** (a list of keys).
Metadata and their use are described in the :ref:`Developers' Manual: Metadata and Lineage
<metadata-lineage>`.

The HTTP RESTful API is divided into these sections:

- :ref:`metadata properties <http-restful-api-metadata-properties>`
- :ref:`metadata tags <http-restful-api-metadata-tags>`
- :ref:`searching properties <http-restful-api-metadata-searching>`
- :ref:`viewing lineage <http-restful-api-metadata-lineage>`
- :ref:`metadata for a run of a program <http-restful-api-metadata-run>`

Metadata keys, values, and tags must conform to the CDAP :ref:`alphanumeric extra extended
character set <supported-characters>`, and are limited to 50 characters in length. The entire
metadata object associated with a single entity is limited to 10K bytes in size.

There is one reserved word for property keys and values: *tags*, either as ``tags`` or
``TAGS``. Tags themselves have no reserved words.

In this API, ``<base-url>`` is as described under :ref:`Conventions
<http-restful-api-conventions>`.

Metadata Properties
===================

Annotating Properties
---------------------
To annotate user metadata properties for an application, dataset, or stream, submit an HTTP POST request::

  POST <base-url>/namespaces/<namespace>/<entity-type>/<entity-id>/metadata/properties
  
or, for a particular program of a specific application::

  POST <base-url>/namespaces/<namespace>/apps/<app-id>/<program-type>/<program-id>/metadata/properties

with the metadata properties as a JSON string map of string-string pairs, passed in the
request body::

  {
    "key1" : "value1",
    "key2" : "value2",
    // ...
  }
  
If the entity requested is found, new keys will be added and existing keys will be
updated. Existing keys not in the properties map will not be deleted.

or, for a particular program of a specific application::

  GET <base-url>/namespaces/<namespace>/apps/<app-id>/<program-type>/<program-id>/metadata/properties

with the metadata properties returned as a JSON string map of string-string pairs, passed
in the response body (pretty-printed)::

  {
    "key1" : "value1",
    "key2" : "value2",
    // ...

.. _http-restful-api-metadata-searching:

Searching for Metadata
======================
To find which applications, datasets, or streams have a particular user metadata property or
user metadata tag, submit an HTTP GET request::

  GET <base-url>/namespaces/<namespace>/metadata/search?query=<term>&target=<entity-type>

Entities with the specified terms are returned as list of entity IDs::

  [
      {
          "entityId": {
              "id": {
                  "applicationId": "PurchaseHistory",
                  "namespace": {
                      "id": "default"
                  }
              },

          }
      }
  ]

   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<namespace>``
     - Namespace ID
   * - ``<entity-type>``
     - One of ``app``, ``dataset``, ``program``, or ``stream``
   * - ``<term>``
     - Query term, as described below

   * - Status Codes
     - Description
   * - ``200 OK``
     - Entity IDs of entities with the metadata properties specified were returned as a
       list of strings in the body of the response

.. rubric:: Query Terms

CDAP supports prefix-based search of metadata properties and tags. Search for specific tags by using
either a complete or partial name with an asterisk ``*``.

Search for properties and tags by specifying one of:

- a complete property key-value pair, separated by a colon, such as ``type:production``

- a complete property key with a partial value, such as ``type:prod*``

- a complete ``tags`` key with a complete or partial value, such as ``tags:prod*`` to search for tags only

- a complete or partial value, such as ``prod*``; this will return both properties and tags

Searches are case-insensitive.

.. _http-restful-api-metadata-lineage:

Viewing Lineages
================
To view the lineage of a dataset or stream, submit an HTTP GET request::

  GET <base-url>/namespaces/<namespace>/<entity-type>/<entity-id>/lineage?start=<start-ts>&end=<end-ts>&maxLevels=<max-levels>

where:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<namespace>``
     - Namespace ID
   * - ``<entity-type>``
     - One of ``dataset`` or ``stream``
   * - ``<entity-id>``
     - Name of the ``dataset`` or ``stream``
   * - ``<start-ts>``
     - Starting time-stamp of lineage (inclusive), in seconds. Supports ``now``, ``now-1h``, etc. syntax.
   * - ``<end-ts>``
     - Ending time-stamp of lineage (exclusive), in seconds. Supports ``now``, ``now-1h``, etc. syntax.
   * - ``<max-levels>``
     - Maximum number of levels

See in the Metrics HTTP RESTful API :ref:`Querying by a Time Range <http-restful-api-metrics-time-range>`
for examples of the "now" time syntax.

The lineage will be returned as a JSON string in the body of the response. The number of
levels of the request (``<max-levels>``) determines how far back the provenance of the
data in the lineage chain is calculated, as described in the :ref:`Metadata and Lineage <metadata-lineage-lineage>`.

Lineage JSON consists of three main sections:

- **Relations:** contains information on data accessed by programs.
  Access type can be *read*, *write*, *both*, or *unknown*.
  It also contains the *runid* of the program that accessed the data, 
  and the specifics of any *component* of a program
  that also accessed the data. For example, a flowlet is a *component* of a flow.
- **Data:** contains Datasets or Streams that were accessed by programs.
- **Programs:** contains information on programs (flows, MapReduce, Spark, workers, etc.) 
  that accessed the data.
