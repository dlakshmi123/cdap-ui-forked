Release 2.5.2
=============

CDAP Bug Fixes
--------------

- Fixed a problem with a Coopr-provisioned secure cluster failing to start due to a classpath
  issue (`CDAP-478 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-478>`__).
- Fixed a problem with the WISE app zip distribution not packaged correctly; a new version
  (0.2.1) has been released (`CDAP-533 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-533>`__).
- Fixed a problem with the examples and tests incorrectly using the ByteBuffer.array
  method when reading a Stream event (`CDAP-549 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-549>`__).
- Fixed a problem with the Authentication Server so that it can now communicate with an LDAP
  instance over SSL (`CDAP-556 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-556>`__).
- Fixed a problem with the program class loader to allow applications to use a different
  version of a library than the one that the CDAP platform uses; for example, a different
  Kafka library (`CDAP-559 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-559>`__).
- Fixed a problem with CDAP master not obtaining new delegation tokens after running for 
  ``hbase.auth.key.update.interval`` milliseconds (`CDAP-562 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-562>`__).
- Fixed a problem with the transaction not being rolled back when a user service handler throws an exception 
  (`CDAP-607 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-607>`__).

Other Changes
-------------

- Improved the CDAP documentation:

  - Re-organized the documentation into three manuals—Developers' Manual, Administration
    Manual, Reference Manual—and a set of examples, how-to guides and tutorials;
  - Documents are now in smaller chapters, with numerous updates and revisions;
  - Added a link for downloading an archive of the documentation for offline use;
  - Added links to examples relevant to a particular component;
  - Added suggested deployment architectures for Distributed CDAP installations;
  - Added a glossary;
  - Added navigation aids at the bottom of each page; and
  - Tested and updated the Standalone CDAP examples and their documentation.

Known Issues
------------
- Currently, applications that include Spark or Scala classes in user classes not extended
  from either ``JavaSparkProgram`` or ``ScalaSparkProgram`` (depending upon the language)
  fail with a class loading error. Spark or Scala classes should not be used outside of the
  Spark program. (`CDAP-599 <https://issues.cask.co/browse/CDAP-599>`__)
- See also the *Known Issues* of `version 2.5.0. <#known-issues-250>`_


Release 2.5.1
=============

CDAP Bug Fixes
--------------

- Improved the documentation of the CDAP Authentication and Stream Clients, both Java and Python APIs.
- Fixed problems with the CDAP Command-line Interface (CLI):

  - Did not work in non-interactive mode;
  - Printed excessive debug log messages;
  - Relative paths did not work as expected; and 
  - Failed to execute SQL queries.
  
- Removed dependencies on SNAPSHOT artifacts for *netty-http* and *auth-clients*. 
- Corrected an error in the message printed by the startup script ``cdap.sh``.
- Resolved a problem with the reading of the properties file by the CDAP Flume Client of CDAP Ingest library
  without first checking if authentication was enabled.

Other Changes
-------------

- The scripts ``send-query.sh``, ``access-token.sh`` and ``access-token.bat`` has been replaced by the 
  :ref:`CDAP Command-line Interface, <cli>` ``cdap-cli.sh``.
- The CDAP Command-line Interface now uses and saves access tokens when connecting to a secure CDAP instance.
- The CDAP Java Stream Client now allows empty String events to be sent.
- The CDAP Python Authentication Client's ``configure()`` method now takes a dictionary rather than a filepath.

Known Issues
------------
See *Known Issues* of `the previous version. <#known-issues-250>`_


Release 2.5.0
=============

New Features
------------

Ad-hoc querying
.................
- Capability to write to Datasets using SQL

  - Execute a SQL query from the Console
  - View list of active, completed queries
  - Download query results

Datasets
.................
- Datasets can be tested with TestBase outside of the context of an Application
- CDAP now checks Datasets for compatibility in a verification stage
- The Transaction engine uses server-side filtering for efficient transactional reads
- Dataset specifications can now be dynamically reconfigured through the use of RESTful endpoints
- The Bundle jar format is now used for Dataset libs
- Increments on Datasets are now read-less

Services
.................
- Added simplified APIs for using Services from other programs such as MapReduce, Flows and Procedures
- Added an API for creating Services and handlers that can use Datasets transactionally
- Added a RESTful API to make requests to a Service via the Router

Security
.................
- Added authorization logging
- Added Kerberos authentication to Zookeeper secret keys
- Added support for SSL

Spark Integration
.................
- Supports running Spark programs as a part of CDAP applications in Standalone mode
- Supports running Spark programs written with Spark versions 1.0.1 or 1.1.0 
- Supports Spark's *MLib* and *GraphX* modules
- Includes three examples demonstrating CDAP Spark programs
- Adds display of Spark program logs and history in the CDAP Console

Streams
.................
- Added a collection of applications, tools and APIs specifically for the ETL (Extract, Transform and Loading) of data
- Added support for asynchronously writing to Streams

Clients
.................
- Added a Command-line Interface
- Added a Java Client Interface


Major CDAP Bug Fixes
--------------------
- Fixed a problem with a HADOOP_HOME exception stacktrace when unit-testing an Application
- Fixed an issue with Hive creating directories in /tmp in the Standalone and unit-test frameworks
- Fixed a problem with type inconsistency of Service API calls, where numbers were showing up as strings
- Fixed an issue with the premature expiration of long-term Authentication Tokens
- Fixed an issue with the Dataset size metric showing data operations size instead of resource usage


.. _known-issues-250:

Known Issues
------------
- Metrics for MapReduce jobs aren't populated on secure Hadoop clusters
- The metric for the number of cores shown in the Resources view of the CDAP Console will be zero
  unless YARN has been configured to enable virtual cores
