ETL is **Extract**, **Transform** and **Load** of data, a common first-step in any data
application. CDAP endeavors to make performing ETL possible out-of-box without writing
code; instead, you just configure CDAP appropriately and operate it.

.. rubric:: Cask Hydrator

CDAP supports users with self-service batch and real-time data ingestion combined with
ETL, expressly for the building of Hadoop data lakes. Called **Cask Hydrator**, it
provides CDAP users a seamless and easy way to configure and operate ingestion pipelines
from different types of sources and data.

*Cask Hydrator* provides an easy method of configuring *pipelines* using a visual editor.
You drag and drop sources, transformations, and sinks, configuring an ETL pipeline within
minutes. It provides an operational view of the resulting ETL pipeline that allows for
monitoring of metrics, logs, and other run-time information.
