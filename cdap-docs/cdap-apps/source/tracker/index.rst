Cask Tracker
============   

Introduction
============

Cask Tracker ("Tracker") is a self-service CDAP extension that automatically captures
:ref:`metadata <metadata-lineage>` and lets you see how data is flowing into and out 
of datasets, streams, and stream views.

It allows you to perform impact and root-cause analysis, and delivers an audit-trail for
auditability and compliance. Tracker furnishes access to structured information that
describes, explains, locates, and makes it easier to retrieve, use, and manage datasets.

Tracker also allows for the storage of metadata where it can be accessed and indexed. This
allows it to be is easily searched and provides consistent, high-quality metadata.

Tracker's UI shows a graphical visualization of the :ref:`lineage
<metadata-lineage-lineage>` of an entity. A lineage shows |---| for a specified time range
|---| all data access of the entity, and details of where that access originated from.


**Harvest, Index, and Track Datasets**

- Immediate, timely, and seamless capture of technical, business, and operational metadata,
  enabling faster and better traceability of all datasets.

- Tracker quickly, reliably, and accurately indexes technical, business, and operational metadata
  to help locate datasets.

- Through its use of lineage, it lets you understand the impact of changing a dataset on
  other datasets, processes or queries.

- Tracks the flow of data across enterprise systems and data lakes.

- Provides trusted and complete metadata on datasets, enabling traceability to resolve
  data issues and to improve data quality.


**Supports Standardization, Governance, and Compliance Needs**

- Provide IT with the traceability needed in governing datasets and in applying compliance
  rules through seamless integration with other extensions.

- Tracker has consistent definitions of metadata-containing information about the data to reconcile
  differences in terminologies.

- It helps you in the understanding of the lineage of your business-critical data.


**Blends Metadata Analytics and Integrations**

- See how your datasets are being created, accessed, and processed.

- Extensible integrations are available with enterprise-grade MDM (master data management)
  systems such as `Cloudera Navigator <https://www.cloudera.com/products/cloudera-navigator.html>`__ 
  for centralizing metadata repository and the delivery of complete, accurate, and correct
  data.


Example Use Case
----------------
An example use case describes how Tracker was employed in the `data cleansing and validating of
three billion records <http://customers.cask.co/rs/882-OYR-915/images/tracker-casestudy1.pdf>`__.


Tracker Application
===================
The Cask Tracker application consists of an application in CDAP with two programs and two datasets:

- ``_Tracker`` application: names begins with an underscore
- ``AuditLog`` service: it exposes the Tracker audit log as an API
- ``AuditLogFlow`` flow: subscribes to Kafka audit messages and stores them in the ``_auditLog``	dataset
- ``_auditLog`` custom dataset: type ``co.cask.tracker.entity.AuditLogTable``
- ``_kafkaOffset`` dataset: type key-value table

The Tracker UI is shipped with CDAP, started automatically as part of the CDAP UI, and is available at:

  http://localhost:9999/ns/default/tracker/home
  
or (Distributed CDAP):

  http://host:dashboard-bind-port/ns/default/tracker/home
  

Tracker is built from a system artifact included with CDAP, |literal-cask-tracker-version-jar|.

.. highlight:: xml  

Installation
============
Cask Tracker is deployed from its system artifact included with CDAP. A CDAP administrator
does not need to build anything to add Cask Tracker to CDAP; they merely need to enable
the application after starting CDAP.

These two properties are used by Tracker for its audit log functionality::
  
  <!-- Audit Configuration -->

  <property>
    <name>audit.enabled</name>
    <value>true</value>
    <description>
      Determines whether to publish audit messages to Apache Kafka
    </description>
  </property>

  <property>
    <name>audit.kafka.topic</name>
    <value>audit</value>
    <description>
      Apache Kafka topic name to which audit messages are published
    </description>
  </property>

As these are the default settings for these properties, they do not need to be included in the
``cdap-site.xml`` file.

Enabling Tracker
----------------
To enable Tracker, go to the **Tracker UI** at 
(in the SDK) http://localhost:9999/ns/default/tracker/home or 
(Distributed CDAP) http://host:dashboard-bind-port/ns/default/tracker/home 
and press the ``"Enable Tracker"`` button to deploy and start Tracker.

Once pressed, the application will be deployed, the datasets created (if necessary), the flow and service
started, and search and audit logging will become available.

If you are enabling Tracker from outside the UI, you will, in addition to enabling auditing 
in the ``cdap-site.xml`` as described above, need to follow these steps:

- Using the CDAP CLI, load the artifact (|literal-cask-tracker-version-jar|):

  .. container:: highlight

    .. parsed-literal::

      |cdap >| load artifact target/|cask-tracker-version-jar|

.. highlight:: json  

- Create an application configuration file (``appconfig.txt``) that contains the Kafka
  Audit Log reader configuration (the property ``auditLogKafkaConfig``). It is the Kafka
  Consumer Flowlet configuration information. For example::
    
    {
      "config": {
        "auditLogKafkaConfig": {
          "zookeeperString": "<host>:<port>/cdap/kafka"
        }
      }
    }

  substituting for ``<host>`` and ``<port>`` with appropriate values.
  
- Create a CDAP application using the configuration file:

  .. container:: highlight

    .. parsed-literal::

      |cdap >| create app TrackerApp tracker |cask-tracker-version| USER appconfig.txt

**Audit Log Kafka Config:**

This key contains a property map with:

- Required Properties:

  - ``zookeeperString``: Kafka Zookeeper string that can be used to subscribe to the CDAP audit log updates
  - ``brokerString``: Kafka Broker string to which CDAP audit log data is published

  *Note:* Specify either the ``zookeeperString`` or the ``brokerString``.

- Optional Properties:

  - ``topic``: Kafka Topic to which CDAP audit updates are published; default is ``audit`` which
    corresponds to the default topic used in CDAP for audit log updates
  - ``numPartitions``: Number of Kafka partitions; default is set to ``10``
  - ``offsetDataset``: Name of the dataset where Kafka offsets are stored; default is ``_kafkaOffset``

Restarting CDAP
---------------
As Tracker is an application running inside CDAP, it does not start up automatically when
CDAP is restarted. Each time that you start CDAP, you will need to re-enable Tracker.
Re-enabling Tracker does not recreate the datasets; instead, the same datasets as were
used in previous runs are used.

If you are using the audit log feature of Tracker, it is best that Tracker be enabled
**before** you begin any other applications.

If the installation of CDAP is an upgrade from a previous version, all activity and
datasets prior to the enabling of Tracker will not be available or seen in the Tracker UI.

Disabling and Removing Tracker
------------------------------
If for some reason you need to disable or remove Tracker, you would need to:

- stop the Tracker flow
- stop the Tracker service
- delete the Tracker application
- delete the Tracker datasets


Tracker and its UI
==================

Search
------
Searching in Tracker is provided by an interface similar to that of a popular search engine:

.. figure:: ../_images/tracker-home-search.png
  :figwidth: 100%
  :width: 800px
  :align: center
  :class: bordered-image

In the text box, you enter your search terms:

- Multiple search terms can be searched by separating them with a space character.
- Search terms are case-insensitive.
- Search the metadata of entities by using either a complete or partial name followed by
  an asterisk ``*``, as described in the :ref:`Metadata HTTP RESTful API
  <http-restful-api-metadata-query-terms>`.
- Tracker searches tags, properties, and schema of CDAP datasets, streams, and stream views.

For example, if you have just started CDAP and enabled Tracker, you could enter a search
term such as ``a* k*``, which will find all entities that begin with the letter ``a`` or
``k``.

The results would appear similar to this:

.. figure:: ../_images/tracker-first-search.png
  :figwidth: 100%
  :width: 800px
  :align: center
  :class: bordered-image

In this example, Tracker has found two datasets that satisfy the condition. The search
used is shown in the upper-left, and the results show both the datasets found with
information and links for each.

**On the left side** is the **Filter** pane, which provides information on what was found (the
entities and metadata types) with statistics of the number found for each category. A blue
checkbox allows you to filter based on these attributes. If you mouse over a category, an
``only`` link will appear, which allows you to select *only* that category as a filter.

Note that the *entities* and *metadata* filters have an ``and`` relationship; at least one
selection must be made in each of *entities* and *metadata* for there to be any results
that appear.

**On the right side** is a sortable list of results. It is sortable by *Create Date* or the entity
ID (name), either *A-Z* (alphabetical ascending), or *Z-A* (alphabetical descending).

Each entry in the list provides a summery of information about the entity, and its name is
a hyperlink to further details: metadata, lineage, and audit log.

The **Jump** button provides three actions: go to the selected entity in CDAP, or add it
to a new Cask Hydrator pipeline as a source or as a sink. Datasets can be added as sources or
sinks to batch pipelines, while streams can be sources in batch pipelines or sinks in
real-time pipelines.

Entity Details
--------------
Clicking on a name in the search results list will take you to details for a particular
entity. Details are provided on three separate tabs: *Metadata*, *Lineage*, and *Audit
Log*.

**Metadata**

The *Metadata* tab provides lists of the *System Tags*, *User Tags*, *Schema*, *User
Properties*, and *System Properties* that were found for the entity. The values shown will
vary depending on the type of entity and each individual entity. For instance, a stream
may have a schema attached, and if so, it will be displayed.

.. figure:: ../_images/tracker-metadata.png
  :figwidth: 100%
  :width: 800px
  :align: center
  :class: bordered-image

**Lineage**

The *Lineage* tab shows the relationship between an entity and the programs that are
interacting with it. As different lineage diagrams can be created for the same entity,
depending on the particular set of programs selected to construct the diagram, a green
button in the shape of an arrow is used to cycle through the different lineage digrams
that a particular entity participates in.

A date menu in the left side of the digram lets you control the time range that the
diagram displays. By default, the last seven days are used, though a custom range can be
specified, in addition to common time ranges (two weeks to one year).

.. figure:: ../_images/tracker-lineage.png
  :figwidth: 100%
  :width: 800px
  :align: center
  :class: bordered-image

**Audit Log**

The *Audit Log* tab shows each record in the *_auditLog* dataset that has been created for
that particular entity, displayed in reverse chronological order. Because of how datasets
work in CDAP, reading and writing from a flow or service to a dataset shows an access of
"UNKNOWN" rather than indicating if it was read or write access. This will be addressed in
a future release.

A date menu in the left side of the digram lets you control the time range that the
diagram displays. By default, the last seven days are used, though a custom range can be
specified, in addition to common time ranges (two weeks to one year).

.. figure:: ../_images/tracker-audit-log.png
  :figwidth: 100%
  :width: 800px
  :align: center
  :class: bordered-image

Integrations
------------

Tracker allows for an easy integration with `Cloudera Navigator
<https://www.cloudera.com/products/cloudera-navigator.html>`__  by providing a UI to
connecting to a Navigator instance:

.. figure:: ../_images/tracker-integration-configuration.png
  :figwidth: 100%
  :width: 800px
  :align: center
  :class: bordered-image

Details on completing this form are described in CDAP's documentation on
:ref:`Navigator Integration Application <navigator-integration>`.

Tracker HTTP RESTful API
========================

Tracker supports searching of the *_auditLog* dataset through an HTTP RESTful API. (See
the :ref:`Reference Manual: HTTP RESTful API <http-restful-api-introduction>` for details
on the conventions used for this API.) To search for audit log entries for a particular
dataset, stream, or stream view, submit an HTTP GET request::

  GET /v3/namespaces/<namespace-id>/apps/_Tracker/services/AuditLog/methods/auditlog/<entity-type>/<name>
    [?startTime=<time>][&endTime=<time>][&offset=<offset>][&limit=<limit>]

where:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``namespace-id``
     - Namespace ID
   * - ``entity-type``
     - One of ``dataset``, ``stream``, or ``stream_view``
   * - ``name``
     - Name of the ``entity-type``
   * - ``time`` *(optional)*
     - Time range defined by start (*startTime*, default ``0``) and end (*endTime*,
       default ``now``) times, where the times are either in milliseconds since the start of
       the Epoch, or a relative time, using ``now`` and times added to it. You can apply
       simple math, using ``now`` for the current time, ``s`` for seconds, ``m`` for
       minutes, ``h`` for hours and ``d`` for days. For example: ``now-5d-12h`` is 5 days
       and 12 hours ago.
   * - ``offset`` *(optional)*
     - The offset to start the results at for paging; default is ``0``.
   * - ``limit`` *(optional)*
     - The maximum number of results to return in the results; default is ``10``.
     
A successful query will return with the results as a field along with a count of the total
results available, plus the offset used for the set of results returned. This is to allow
for pagination through the results. Results are sorted so that the most recent audit event
in the time range is returned first.

.. highlight:: json  

If there are no results, an empty set of results will be returned (pretty-printed here for
display)::

  {
    "totalResults": 0,
    "results": [],
    "offset": 0
  }


Example:

.. tabbed-parsed-literal::

  $ curl -w'\n' -X GET 'http://localhost:10000/v3/namespaces/default/apps/_Tracker/services/AuditLog/methods/auditlog/stream/who?limit=1&startTime=now-5d-12h&endTime=now-12h'
