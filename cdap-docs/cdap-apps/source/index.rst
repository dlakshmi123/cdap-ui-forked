CDAP Applications
=================

CDAP comes packaged with several system artifacts to create two types of applications,
simply by configuring the system artifacts and not writing any code at all:

.. |hydrator| replace:: **Cask Hydrator and ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) Pipelines**
.. _hydrator: hydrator/index.html

.. |dqa| replace:: **Data Quality Application**
.. _dqa: data-quality/index.html

- |hydrator|_
- |dqa|_

An application created from a configured system artifact following the ETL pattern is
referred to as an *ETL pipeline* or (interchangeably) as an *ETL application*. Similarly, an
application built following the Data Quality pattern is referred to as a *Data Quality
application*.

In the future, a variety of system artifacts will be delivered. The framework is
extensible: users can write their own artifacts if they so chose, and can
manage the lifecycle of their custom applications using CDAP.
