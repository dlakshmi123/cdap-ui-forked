/**
 * This package contains the WordCount sample Application that counts words and tracks the associations between words.
 * This is a slightly modified version of the classic WordCount example. 
 * 
 * This WordCount Application consists of:
 * 
 * 1. A Stream named wordStream that receives strings of words to be counted.
 * 
 * 2. A Flow named WordCounter processes the strings from the Stream and calculates the word counts
 *    and other word statistics using four Flowlets:
 *    - The splitter splits the input string into words and aggregates and persists global statistics;
 *    - The counter takes words as inputs and calculates and persists per-word statistics;
 *    - The unique Flowlet calculates the unique number of words seen;
 *    - The associator stores word associations between all of the words in each input string.
 *
 * 3. A Procedure named RetrieveCounts serves read requests for the calculated word counts,
 *    statistics and associations. It supports two methods:
 *    - getCount() accesses the word count of a specified word and its word associations;
 *    - getStats() accesses the global word statistics.
 *
 * 4. Four DataSets used by the Flow and Procedure to model, store, and serve the necessary data:
 *    - A core Table named wordStats to track global word statistics;
 *    - A system KeyValueTable DataSet named wordCounts counts the occurrences of each word;
 *    - A custom UniqueCountTable DataSet named uniqueCount determines and counts the number of unique words seen;
 *    - A custom AssociationTable DataSet named wordAssocs tracks associations between words.
