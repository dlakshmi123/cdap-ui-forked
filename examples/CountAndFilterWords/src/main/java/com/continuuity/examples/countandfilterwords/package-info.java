/**
 * This package contains the CountAndFilterWords sample application,
 * a variation of CountTokens that illustrates that a Flowlet's output can
 * be consumed by multiple downstream Flowlets.
 *
 * In addition to counting all tokens, CountAndFilterWords sends all tokens to a filter that
 * drops all tokens that are not upper case.
 *
 * The upper case tokens are then counted by a separate Flowlet.
