Ticker Application
==================
This application pulls in stock market activity data and stores it in 
datasets that allow querying for that data with various filters.

Installation
============

Build the application jar
mvn clean package

Deploy the application to a reactor instance defined by its host and port (defaults to localhost:10000):
bin/deploy --app target/ticker-0.1.0.jar --gateway [host]:[port]

Start application flows and procedures:
bin/ticker --action start --gateway [host]:[port]

Make sure they are running:
bin/ticker --action status --gateway [host]:[port]

Generate some random stock order data (fake data, used for bin/orders script):
bin/generate-orders --gateway [host]:[port]

Inject some stock symbols that you want timeseries information for (real data, used for bin/get-ticker script):
bin/inject-symbol --symbol AAPL --gateway [host]:[port]

Querying
========

To get a summary of a stock over some time period:
bin/get-ticker --type summary --start "now-7d" --end "now" --symbol "AAPL" --gateway [host]:[port]

To get timeseries data of a stock over some time period:
bin/get-ticker --type timeseries --start "now-1d" --end "now" --symbol "AAPL" --gateway [host]:[port]

To get order data filtered by specific key value pairs:
bin/orders --start "now-1d" --end "now" --symbol AAPL --exchange NASDAQ --broker JPMC --currency USD --gateway [host]:[port]

start and end time can be given as a timestamp in seconds, or it can be given as "now", 
or "now-X[unit]", where unit is 's' for seconds, 'm' for minutes, 'h' for hours, and
'd' for days.
