/**
 * Package for the CountTokens sample application.
 * 
 * Reads events (= byte[] body, Map<String,String> headers) from the 'text' input Stream.
 * 
 * Tokenizes the text in the body and in the header named 'title', ignores all other headers.
 * 
 * Each token is cloned into two tokens:
 *   a) the upper case version of the token
 *   b) the original token with a field prefix 'title',
 *   or 'text' if the token is from the body of the event.
 *
 * All of the cloned tokens are counted using increment operations.
