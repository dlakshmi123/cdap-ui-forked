  For this directive to work we need to know the height of parent to calculate height of the current
    container which using this directive. For instance something like this,

    <div class="parent" parent-height>
      <div class="child" my-calculate-height>

      </div>
    </div>
  FIXME: This is not super intutive for now but this will fixed in release 3.3 of cdap.
