  <h2>Property and Tag Search Tips</h2>

  <marked>
    - Specify a complete property key-value pair, separated by a colon:

       ex. __type:production__

    - Specify a complete property key with a partial value:

      ex. __type:prod*__

    - Specify a complete tags key with a complete or partial value:

      ex. __production or tags:prod*__

    - Searching for tags with only a complete or partial value (ex. __prod*__) will return both properties and tags.

    - Multiple search terms separated by space (ex. __type:prod* author:joe__) will return entities having either of the terms in their metadata.


    Since CDAP also annotates system metadata to entities by default as mentioned in [System Metadata](http://docs.cask.co/cdap/current/en/developers-manual/building-blocks/metadata-lineage.html?highlight=system%20metadata), the following special search queries are also supported:

    - datasets, streams or views with schema field:
      - field name only: ``` &lt;field-name&gt; ```
      - field name with a type: ``` &lt;field-name&gt;:&lt;field-type&gt; ```
      - where field-type can be simple types:
        - int, long, boolean, float, double, bytes, string, enum array, map, record or union
