/**
 * This is the abstract base class for all datasets. A dataset is an
 * implementation of a data pattern that can be reused across programs and
 * applications. The life cycle of a dataset is as follows:
 * <li>An application declares the datasets that its programs will use.</li>
 * <li>When the application is deployed, the DataSet object is created and
 *   its configure() method is called. This method returns a specification
 *   that contains all information needed to instantiate the dataset at
 *   runtime.</li>
 * <li>At runtime (in a flow or procedure), the dataset is instantiated
 *   by dependency injection using the @UseDataSet annotation. This uses the
 *   constructor of the the dataset that takes the above specification
 *   as an argument. It is important that the dataset is instantiated through
 *   the context: this also makes sure that the DataFabric runtime is
 *   properly injected into the dataset.
 *   </li>
 * <li>Hence every DataSet must implement a configure() method and a
 *   constructor from DataSetSpecification.</li>
 *
 * @deprecated As of Reactor 2.3.0, replaced by {@link com.continuuity.api.dataset.Dataset}
