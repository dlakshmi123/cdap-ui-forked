/**
 *  Interface that needs to be implemented for handling HTTP methods. init and destroy methods can be used to manage
 *  the lifecycle of the object. The framework will call init and destroy during startup and shutdown respectively.
 *  No handles will be called before init method of the class is called or after the destroy method is called.
 *  The handlers should be annotated with Jax-RS annotations to handle appropriate path and HTTP Methods.
 *  Note: Only the annotations in the given handler object will be inspected and be available for routing. The
 *  annotations from the base class (if extended) will not be applied to the given handler object.
 *  Note: The framework that calls the handler assumes that the implementation is threadsafe.
 *  Note: If the HttpHandler implementation is extended, the annotations are not inherited from the base class.
 *
 *  Example:
 *  public class ApiHandler implements HttpHandler{
 *    @Override
 *    public void init(HandlerContext context){
 *      //Perform bootstrap operations before any of the handlers in this class gets called.
 *    }
 *    @Override
 *    public void destroy(HandlerContext context){
 *      //Perform teardown operations before the server shuts down.
 *    }
 *
 *    @Path("/common/v1/widgets")
 *    @GET
 *    public void handleGet(HttpRequest request, HttpResponder responder){
 *      //Handle Http request
 *    }
 *  }
 *
