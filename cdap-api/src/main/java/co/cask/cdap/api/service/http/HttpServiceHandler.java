/**
 * Interface to be implemented to handle HTTP requests. This interface can be implemented and passed along to
 * custom user services. Classes that implement this interface can add methods with the @Path annotation
 * to specify the endpoint which that method handles. It can also use the @GET, @POST, @PUT, @DELETE annotations
 * to specify the type of HTTP requests that it handles.
 *
 * Example:
 * <p>
 *   <pre><code>
 *      public class MyHttpHanlder implements HttpServiceHandler {
 *
 *        {@literal @}GET
 *        {@literal @}Path("/ping")
 *        public void process(HttpServiceRequest request, HttpServiceResponder responder) {
 *          responder.sendString("Hello World");
 *        }
 *
 *        {@literal @}Override
 *        public void configure(HttpServiceConfigurer configurer) { }
 *
 *        {@literal @}Override
 *        public void initialize(HttpServiceContext context) throws Exception { }
 *
 *        {@literal @}Override
 *        public void destroy() { }
 *      }
