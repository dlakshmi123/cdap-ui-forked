 * This interface extends serializable because the closures are anonymous class in Java and Spark Serializes the
 * closures before sending it to worker nodes. This serialization of inner anonymous class expects the outer
 * containing class to be serializable else java.io.NotSerializableException is thrown. We do not expect user job
 * class to be serializable so we serialize this interface which user job class implements to have a neater API.
