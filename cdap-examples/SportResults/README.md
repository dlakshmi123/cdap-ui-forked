# Sports example

Example application that illustrates PartitionedFileSet datasets using sport results.

Features introduced: Partitioned file sets, MapReduce with runtime arguments, Ad-hoc queries over file sets.

- Uses a partitioned file set to store game results. It is partitioned by league and season, and each partition
  is a file containing the results in one league for a season; for example, the 2014 season of the NFL
  (National Football League).
- Results are uploaded into the file set using a service.
- The results can be explored using ad-hoc SQL queries.
- A MapReduce program that reads game results for a sports league and
  aggregates total counts such as games won and lost, or points scored and conceded, across all
  seasons, and writes the results to a partitioned file set that is partitioned by league.
- The totals can also be queried using ad-hoc SQL.
