/**
 * Interface to grant/revoke {@link Principal principals} authorization for {@link Action actions} on
 * {@link EntityId CDAP entities}. Authorization extensions must implement this interface to delegate authorization
 * to appropriate authorization backends. The contract with Authorization extensions is as below:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Authorization is enabled setting the parameter {@code security.authorization.enabled} to true in
 *   {@code cdap-site.xml}.</li>
 *   <li>The path to the extension jar bundled with all its dependencies must be specified by
 *   {@code security.authorization.extension.jar.path} in cdap-site.xml</li>
 *   <li>The extension jar must contain a class that implements {@link Authorizer}. This class must be specified as
 *   the {@link Attributes.Name#MAIN_CLASS} in the extension jar's manifest file.</li>
 *   <li>The contract with the class that implements {@link Authorizer} is that it must have a public constructor that
 *   accepts a single {@link Properties} object as parameter. This constructor is invoked with a {@link Properties}
 *   object that is populated with all configuration settings from {@code cdap-site.xml} that have keys with the prefix
 *   {@code security.authorization.extension.config}.</li>
 * </ul>
