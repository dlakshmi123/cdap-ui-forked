# Cask Data Application Platform - CDAP

![CDAP Logo](cdap-docs/developer-guide/source/_images/CDAP.png)

**Introduction**

The Cask Data Application Platform (CDAP) is an application server that provides a
comprehensive platform for the development, deployment and management of data applications 
and the management of data.

Out-of-the-box, its features include transaction management, dataset abstractions, QoS (quality-of-service),
performance, scalability, security, metrics and log collection, and a web-based management console.

CDAP provides data virtualization and application containerization for your data and application
needs. With CDAP, you do not need to understand the implementation or the complexity of Apache 
Hadoop&trade;, HBase or Zookeeper. CDAP provides independence from Hadoop versions and runs on any 
distribution of Hadoop. Its container model allows for the integration of different processing 
paradigms with CDAP's features. It provides a common environment, the abstraction of a unified API, 
lifecycle management and a programming model for both data applications and their data. You can package, 
deploy and manage applications as a single unit.

You can run applications ranging from simple MapReduce Jobs through complete ETL (extract, transform, and load) 
pipelines all the way up to complex, enterprise-scale data-intensive applications. 
Developers can build and test their applications end-to-end in a full-stack, single-node
installation. CDAP can be run either standalone, deployed within the Enterprise or hosted in the Cloud.

For more information, see our collection of 
[Developer Guides and other documentation](http://docs.cask.co/cdap/current/en/index.html).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To install and use CDAP and its included examples, there are a few simple prerequisites:

  1. JDK 6 or JDK 7 (required to run CDAP; note that $JAVA_HOME should be set)
  2. Node.js 0.8.16+ (required to run the CDAP Console)
  3. Apache Maven 3.0+ (required to build the example applications)
  
### Build

You can get started with CDAP by building directly from the latest source code::

```
  git clone https://github.com/caskdata/cdap.git
  cd cdap
  mvn clean package
```

After the build completes, you will have a distribution of the CDAP standalone under the
`cdap-distribution/target/` directory.  

Take the `cdap-<version>.tar.gz` file and unzip it into a suitable location.

For more build options, please refer to the [build instructions](BUILD.md).

## Getting Started

document that will guide you through installing CDAP and running an example application.  

## Where to Go Next

Now that you've had a look at the CDAP SDK, take a look at:

- Examples, located in the `cdap-examples` directory of the CDAP SDK;
- [Selected Examples](http://docs.cask.co/cdap/current/en/getstarted.html#examples) 
  (demonstrating basic features of the CDAP) are located on-line; and
- Developer Guides, located in the source distribution in `cdap-docs/developer-guide/source`
  or [online](http://docs.cask.co/cdap/current/en/index.html).


## How to Contribute

Interested in helping to improve CDAP? We welcome all contributions, whether in filing detailed
bug reports, submitting pull requests for code changes and improvements, or by asking questions and
assisting others on the mailing list.

For quick guide to getting your system setup to contribute to CDAP, take a look at our [Contributor Quickstart Guide](DEVELOPERS.md).

### Bug Reports & Feature Requests

Bugs and tasks are tracked in a public JIRA issue tracker. Details on access will be forthcoming.

### Pull Requests

We have a simple pull-based development model with a consensus-building phase, similar to Apache's
voting process. If you’d like to help make CDAP better by adding new features, enhancing existing
features, or fixing bugs, here's how to do it:

1. If you are planning a large change or contribution, discuss your plans on the `cask-cdap-dev`
   mailing list first.  This will help us understand your needs and best guide your solution in a
   way that fits the project.
2. Fork CDAP into your own GitHub repository.
3. Create a topic branch with an appropriate name.
4. Work on the code to your heart's content.
5. Once you’re satisfied, create a pull request from your GitHub repo (it’s helpful if you fill in
   all of the description fields).
6. After we review and accept your request, we’ll commit your code to the cask/cdap
   repository.

Thanks for helping to improve CDAP!
