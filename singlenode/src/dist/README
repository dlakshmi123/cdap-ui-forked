Continuuity (tm) Reactor Development Kit - ${project.version}

Copyright 2014 Continuuity,Inc. All Rights Reserved.
================================================================================

Continuuity Reactor Development Kit includes a Local Reactor: a fully functioning 
single-node edition of the Continuuity Reactor runtime. You can use this edition to
write, debug and test your Big Data applications, before deploying them to a
remote staging or production Reactor.


Installation
============

To install and use Reactor and the included examples there are a few simple
prerequisites:

  1. JDK 6 or JDK 7 (required to run Reactor, note: $JAVA_HOME should be set)
  2. Node.js 0.8.16+ (required to run the Reactor Dashboard)
  3. Apache Maven 3.0+ (required to build the example applications)

Once you have installed the prerequisites, unzip the Developer Suite
distribution to a suitable directory:

  %> cd <path to SDK>
  %> unzip /tmp/continuuity-sdk-${project.version}.zip


Starting Continuuity Reactor
============================

You are now ready to start Reactor. Do so by running the 'reactor' 
script in the $CONTINUUITY/bin folder:

  %> cd ~/<path to SDK>/continuuity-sdk-${project.version}
  %> ./bin/reactor.sh start
  
or on Windows:
  
  > cd ~\<path to SDK>\continuuity-sdk-${project.version}
  > bin\reactor.bat start
