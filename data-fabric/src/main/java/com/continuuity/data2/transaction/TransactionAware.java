 *  if (txClient.canCommit(changes)) {             // checking conflicts before commit, if none, commit tx
 *    if (dataSet.commitTx()) {                    // try persisting changes
 *      if (txClient.commit(tx)) {                 // if OK, make tx visible; if not - tx stays invisible to others
 *        dataSet.postTxCommit();                  // notifying dataset about tx commit success via callback
 *        rollback = false;
