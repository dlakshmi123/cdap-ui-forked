<p>We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However, we do ask that credit is given
to us for developing ANTLR. By &quot;credit&quot;, we mean that if you use ANTLR or incorporate any
source code into one of your programs (commercial product, research project, or otherwise)
that you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation, research report, etc... If
you like ANTLR and have developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that you
developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the headers remain intact in our source
code. As long as these guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this system
and expect to make other tools available as they are completed.</p>
