/**
 * Internal batch sink used as a connector between pipeline phases.
 * Though this extends BatchSink, this will not be instantiated through the plugin framework, but will
 * be created explicitly through the application.
 *
 * The batch connector is just a PartitionedFileSet, where a partition is the name of a phase that wrote to it.
 * This way, multiple phases can have the same local PartitionedFileSet as a sink, and the source will read data
 * from all partitions.
 *
 * This is because we don't want this to show up as a plugin that users can select and use, and also because
 * it uses features not exposed in the etl api (local workflow datasets).
 *
 * TODO: improve storage format. It is currently a json of the record but that is obviously not ideal
 *
 * @param <T> type of input object
