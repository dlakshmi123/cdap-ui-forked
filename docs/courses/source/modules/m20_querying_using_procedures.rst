Module Objectives
=================

In this module, you will cover:

- Using Procedures for querying Reactor
- Creating a Procedure
- Implementing responses
- Handling errors

----

Querying Reactor
================

**Procedures** let you query the Reactor, its DataSets and retrieve results 

Procedures:

- Allow synchronous calls into the Reactor from an external system
- Perform server-side processing on-demand
- Are similar to a stored procedure in a traditional database

Procedures are typically used to post-process data at query time:

- Filtering
- Aggregating
- Joins over multiple DataSets

----

Procedure Operations
====================

A Procedure can perform all the same operations as a Flowlet

- With the same consistency and durability guarantees
- Deployed into the same pool of application containers as Flows
- Can run multiple instances to increase the throughput of requests

A Procedure implements and exposes a very simple API:

- A method name (String) and
- Arguments (map of Strings)

This implementation is then bound to a REST endpoint and can be
called from any external system

----

Creating and Implementing a Procedure
=====================================

To create a Procedure:

- Implement the ``Procedure`` interface, or 
- More conveniently, extend the ``AbstractProcedure`` class

Configuration and Initialization

- Similar to a Flowlet
- Instead of a process method youâ€™ll define a handler method

Response

- Upon external call, the handler method receives the request and sends a
  response
- The most generic way to send a response is to obtain a ``Writer`` and
  stream out the response as bytes

----

Example Procedure
=================

::

	import static com.continuuity.api.procedure.ProcedureResponse.Code.SUCCESS;
	...
	class HelloWorld extends AbstractProcedure {

	  @Handle("hello")
	  public void wave(ProcedureRequest request,
	                   ProcedureResponder responder) throws IOException {
	    String hello = "Hello " + request.getArgument("who");
	    ProcedureResponse.Writer writer =
	      responder.stream(new ProcedureResponse(SUCCESS));
	    writer.write(ByteBuffer.wrap(hello.getBytes())).close();
	  }
	}

- This uses the most generic way to create the response, which allows you
  to send arbitrary byte content as the response body
- Make sure to close the ``Writer`` when you are done

----

Responding with JSON 
====================

In many cases, you will actually respond with JSON 

Reactor ``ProcedureResponder`` has convenience methods for returning JSON maps:

::

	// Return a JSON map
	Map<String, Object> results = new TreeMap<String, Object>();
	results.put("totalWords", totalWords);
	results.put("uniqueWords", uniqueWords);
	results.put("averageLength", averageLength);
	responder.sendJson(results);

----

Responding to Errors 
====================

Convenience method to respond with an error message:

::

	@Handle("getCount")
	public void getCount(ProcedureRequest request, ProcedureResponder responder)
	                     throws IOException, InterruptedException{
	  String word = request.getArgument("word");
	  if (word == null) {
	    responder.error(Code.CLIENT_ERROR,
	                    "Method 'getCount' requires argument 'word'");
	    return;
	  }
----
