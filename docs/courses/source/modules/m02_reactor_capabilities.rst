----

Module Objectives
=================

In this module, you will look at:

- Continuuity Reactor APIs
- Reactor as an integrated platform
- Reactor's application lifecycle support

.. - Transaction support in Reactor
.. - Idempotency of data objects

----

Continuuity Reactor APIs
========================

- A set of powerful yet simple APIs:

  - Java API
  - REST API

- Aim is to reduce the time to create and implement applications
- Makes available scalable, highly-available system architecture

- Hides the complexity of distributed technologies
- Hides low-level Hadoop and HBase APIs

----

Reactor as an Integrated Platform
=================================

Without a Big Data middleware layer, a developer has to piece together
multiple open source frameworks and runtimes to assemble a complete 
Big Data infrastructure stack.

- Reactor eases creation of these elements of Big Data applications:

  - Collecting
  - Processing
  - Storing
  - Querying data

- Data collected and stored in both structured and unstructured forms
- Processed in real-time and in batch
- Results available for retrieval, visualization, and further analysis

----

Reactor's Application Lifecycle Support
=======================================

Reactor supports developers through the entire application development lifecycle: 

- Development
- Debugging
- Testing
- Continuous integration
- Production

- Eclipse and IntelliJ support

----

Reactor's Application Lifecycle Support
=======================================

- Build, test and debug applications on a laptop with a Local Reactor
- Utilize the application unit test framework for continuous integration
- Deploy the application to either:

  - Development cloud (Sandbox Reactor)
  - Production cloud (Enterprise Reactor)

Module Summary
==============

You have looked at:

- Continuuity Reactor's simple APIs
- Reactor as an integrated platform
- Reactor's application lifecycle support
