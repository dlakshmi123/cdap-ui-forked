Module Objectives
=================

In this module, you will learn:

- What is Continuuity Reactor?
- Continuuity Reactor's APIs
- Reactor as an integrated platform
- Reactor’s application lifecycle support

----

What is Continuuity Reactor?
============================

Continuuity Reactor is an application server

- for modern data architecture
- deployed within the enterprise or
- deployed within the cloud

Provides a robust platform for:

- development
- deployment
- management of data applications
- management of data

----

Continuuity Reactor APIs
========================

- A set of powerful yet simple APIs:

  - Java API
  - REST API

- Aim is to reduce the time to create and implement applications
- Provides a scalable, highly-available system architecture
- Hides the complexity of distributed technologies
- Hides low-level Hadoop and HBase APIs

----

Reactor as an Integrated Platform
=================================

Without a Big Data middleware layer, a developer has to piece together
multiple open source frameworks and runtimes to assemble a complete 
Big Data infrastructure stack

- Reactor eases creation of these elements of Big Data applications:

  - Collecting
  - Processing
  - Storing
  - Querying data

- Data collected and stored in both structured and unstructured forms
- Processed in real-time and in batch
- Results available for retrieval, visualization, and further analysis

----

Reactor’s Application Lifecycle Support
=======================================

Reactor supports developers through the entire application development lifecycle: 

- **Development:** Maven archetype, Java API, REST API
- **Debugging:** local Reactor running on a laptop
- **Testing:** Application unit test framework
- **Continuous integration** 
- **Production deployment:**

  - Development cloud (Sandbox Reactor)
  - Production cloud (Enterprise Reactor)

----

Module Summary
==============

You have now seen:

- Continuuity Reactor described as an application server
- Continuuity Reactor’s two APIs: Java and REST
- Reactor as an integrated platform
- Reactor’s application lifecycle support
