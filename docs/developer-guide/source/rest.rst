Introduction
============

The Continuuity Reactor has an HTTP interface for a multitude of purposes:

- **Stream:** sending data events to a Stream, or to inspect the contents of a Stream
- **Dataset:** interacting with Datasets, Dataset Modules, and Dataset Types
- **Data:** interacting with Datasets (deprecated)
- **Query:** sending ad-hoc queries to Reactor Datasets
- **Procedure:** sending calls to a stored Procedure
- **Reactor Client:** deploying and managing Applications, and managing the life cycle of Flows,
  Procedures, MapReduce jobs, Workflows, and Custom Services
- **Logging:** retrieving Application logs
- **Metrics:** retrieving metrics for system and user Applications (user-defined metrics)
- **Monitor:** checking the status of various Reactor services, both System and Custom

**Note:** The HTTP interface binds to port ``10000``. This port cannot be changed.

Conventions
-----------

In this API, *client* refers to an external application that is calling the Continuuity Reactor using the HTTP interface.

In this API, *Application* refers to a user Application that has been deployed into the Continuuity Reactor.

All URLs referenced in this API have this base::

	http://<gateway>:10000/v2

where ``<gateway>`` is the URL of the Continuuity Reactor. The base URL is represented as::

	<base-url>

For example::

	PUT <base-url>/streams/<new-stream-id>

means
::

	PUT http://<gateway>:10000/v2/streams/<new-stream-id>
	

Text that are variables that you are to replace is indicated by a series of angle brackets (``< >``). For example::

	PUT <base-url>/streams/<new-stream-id>

indicates that—in addition to the ``<base-url>``—the text ``<new-stream-id>`` is a variable
and that you are to replace it with your value, perhaps in this case *mystream*::

	PUT <base-url>/streams/mystream

SSL Required for Sandboxed Continuuity Reactor
----------------------------------------------
When you interact with a Sandboxed Continuuity Reactor,
the Continuuity HTTP APIs require that you use SSL for the connection
and that you authenticate your request by sending your API key in an HTTP header::

	X-Continuuity-ApiKey: <api-key>

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 85
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<api-key>``
     - Continuuity Reactor API key, obtained from an account at
       `Continuuity Accounts <http://accounts.continuuity.com>`__


Working with Reactor Security
-----------------------------
When working with a Reactor cluster with security enabled (``security.enabled=true`` in
``continuuity-site.xml``), all calls to the HTTP APIs must be authenticated.  Clients must first
obtain an access token from the authentication server (see the "Security" section of the
guide). In order to authenticate, all client requests must supply this access token in the
``Authorization`` header of the request::

   Authorization: Bearer wohng8Xae7thahfohshahphaeNeeM5ie

For Reactor-issued access tokens, the authentication scheme must always be ``Bearer``.


Stream HTTP API
===============
This interface supports creating Streams, sending events to a Stream, and reading single events from a Stream.

Streams may have multiple consumers (for example, multiple Flows), each of which may be a group of different agents (for example, multiple instances of a Flowlet).

In order to read events from a Stream, a client application must first obtain a consumer (group) id, which is then passed to subsequent read requests.


Creating a Stream
-----------------
A Stream can be created with an HTTP PUT method to the URL::

	PUT <base-url>/streams/<new-stream-id>

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<new-stream-id>``
     - Name of the Stream to be created

HTTP Responses
..............
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Status Codes
     - Description
   * - ``200 OK``
     - The event either successfully created a Stream or the Stream already exists

Example
.......
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - HTTP Method
     - ``PUT <base-url>/streams/mystream``
   * - Description
     - Create a new Stream named *mystream*

Comments
........
- The ``<new-stream-id>`` should only contain ASCII letters, digits and hyphens.
- If the Stream already exists, no error is returned, and the existing Stream remains in place.

.. rst2pdf: PageBreak

Sending Events to a Stream
--------------------------
An event can be sent to a Stream by sending an HTTP POST method to the URL of the Stream::

	POST <base-url>/streams/<stream-id>

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<stream-id>``
     - Name of an existing Stream

HTTP Responses
..............
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Status Codes
     - Description
   * - ``200 OK``
     - The event was successfully received
   * - ``404 Not Found``
     - The Stream does not exist

:Note: The response will always have an empty body

Example
.......
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - HTTP Method
     - ``POST <base-url>/streams/mystream``
   * - Description
     - Send an event to the existing Stream named *mystream*

Comments
........
- The body of the request must contain the event in binary form.
- You can pass headers for the event as HTTP headers by prefixing them with the *stream-id*::

	<stream-id>.<property>:<string value>

  After receiving the request, the HTTP handler transforms it into a Stream event:

  #. The body of the event is an identical copy of the bytes
     found in the body of the HTTP post request.
  #. If the request contains any headers prefixed with the *stream-id*,
     the *stream-id* prefix is stripped from the header name and
     the header is added to the event.

Reading Events from a Stream: Getting a Consumer-ID
---------------------------------------------------
Get a *Consumer-ID* for a Stream by sending an HTTP POST method to the URL::

	POST <base-url>/streams/<stream-id>/consumer-id

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<stream-id>``
     - Name of an existing Stream

HTTP Responses
..............
.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Status Codes
     - Description
   * - ``200 OK``
     - The event was successfully received and a new ``consumer-id`` was returned
   * - ``404 Not Found``
     - The Stream does not exist

Example
.......
.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 80
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - HTTP Method
     - ``POST <base-url>/streams/mystream/consumer-id``
   * - Description
     - Request a ``Consumer-ID`` for the Stream named *mystream*

Comments
........
- Streams may have multiple consumers (for example, multiple Flows), 
  each of which may be a group of different agents (for example, multiple instances of a Flowlet).
- In order to read events from a Stream, a client application must
  first obtain a consumer (group) id, which is then passed to subsequent read requests.
- The ``Consumer-ID`` is returned in a response header and—for convenience—also in the body of the response::

	X-Continuuity-ConsumerId: <consumer-id>

  Once you have the ``Consumer-ID``, single events can be read from the Stream.

.. rst2pdf: PageBreak

Reading Events from a Stream: Using the Consumer-ID
---------------------------------------------------
A read is performed as an HTTP POST method to the URL::

	POST <base-url>/streams/<stream-id>/dequeue

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<stream-id>``
     - Name of an existing Stream

The request must pass the ``Consumer-ID`` in a header of the form::

	X-Continuuity-ConsumerId: <consumer-id>

HTTP Responses
..............
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Status Codes
     - Description
   * - ``200 OK``
     - The event was successfully received and the result of the read was returned
   * - ``204 No Content``
     - The Stream exists but it is either empty or the given ``Consumer-ID``
       has read all the events in the Stream
   * - ``404 Not Found``
     - The Stream does not exist

Example
.......
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - HTTP Method
     - ``POST <base-url>/streams/mystream/dequeue``
   * - Description
     - Read the next event from an existing Stream named *mystream*

Comments
........
The read will always return the next event from the Stream that was inserted first and has not been read yet
(first-in, first-out or FIFO semantics). If the Stream has never been read from before, the first event will be read.

For example, in order to read the third event that was sent to a Stream,
two previous reads have to be performed after receiving the ``Consumer-ID``.
You can always start reading from the first event by getting a new ``Consumer-ID``.

The response will contain the binary body of the event in its body and a header for each header of the Stream event,
analogous to how you send headers when posting an event to the Stream::

	<stream-id>.<property>:<value>

.. rst2pdf: PageBreak

Truncating a Stream
-------------------
Truncation means the deletion of all events that were written to the Stream. 
This is permanent and cannot be undone.
A Stream can be truncated with an HTTP POST method to the URL::

	POST <base-url>/streams/<stream-id>/truncate

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<stream-id>``
     - Name of an existing Stream

HTTP Responses
..............
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Status Codes
     - Description
   * - ``200 OK``
     - The Stream was successfully truncated
   * - ``404 Not Found``
     - The Stream ``<stream-id>`` does not exist

Example
.......
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - HTTP Method
     - ``POST <base-url>/streams/mystream/truncate``
   * - Description
     - Delete all events in the Stream named *mystream*

.. rst2pdf: PageBreak

Setting Time-To-Live Property of a Stream
------------------------------------------
The Time-To-Live (TTL) property governs how long an event is valid for consumption since 
it was written to the Stream.
The default TTL for all Streams is infinite, meaning that events will never expire.
The TTL property of a Stream can be changed with an HTTP PUT method to the URL::

	PUT <base-url>/streams/<stream-id>/config

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<stream-id>``
     - Name of an existing Stream

The new TTL value is passed in the request body as::

	{ "ttl" : <ttl-in-seconds> }

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<ttl-in-seconds>``
     - Number of seconds that an event will be valid for since ingested

HTTP Responses
..............
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Status Codes
     - Description
   * - ``200 OK``
     - The stream TTL was changed successfully
   * - ``400 Bad Request``
     - The TTL value is not a non-negative integer
   * - ``404 Not Found``
     - The Stream does not exist

Example
.......
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - HTTP Method
     - ``PUT <base-url>/streams/mystream/config``

       with the new TTL value as a JSON string in the body::

	  { "ttl" : 86400 }
     
   * - Description
     - Change the TTL property of the Stream named *mystream* to 1 day


Reading Multiple Events
-----------------------
Reading multiple events is not supported directly by the Stream HTTP API,
but the command-line tool ``stream-client`` demonstrates how to view *all*, the *first N*, or the *last N* events in the Stream.

For more information, see the Stream Command Line Client ``stream-client`` in the ``/bin`` directory of the
Continuuity Reactor SDK distribution.

For usage and documentation of options, run at the command line::

	$ stream-client --help

     - Description
   * - ``200 OK``
     - Dataset was successfully truncated

.. rst2pdf: PageBreak


Data HTTP API (Deprecated)
==========================

The Data API allows you to interact with Continuuity Reactor Tables (the core Datasets) through HTTP.
You can create Tables, truncate Tables, and read, write, modify, or delete data.

For Datasets other than Tables, you can truncate the Dataset using this API.

Creating a new Table
--------------------

To create a new table, issue an HTTP PUT method to the URL::

	PUT <base-url>/tables/<table-name>

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<table-name>``
     - Name of the Table to be created

HTTP Responses
..............
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Status Codes
     - Description
   * - ``200 OK``
     - The event was successfully received and the Table was either created or already exists
   * - ``409 Conflict``
     - A Dataset of a different type already exists with the given name

Example
.......
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - HTTP Method
     - ``PUT <base-url>/tables/streams/mytable``
   * - Description
     - Create a new Table named *mytable*

Comments
........
This will create a Table with the name given by ``<table-name>``.
Table names should only contain ASCII letters, digits and hyphens.
If a Table with the same name already exists, no error is returned,
and the existing Table remains in place.

However, if a Dataset of a different type exists with the same name—for example,
a key/value Table or ``KeyValueTable``—this call will return a ``409 Conflict`` error.

Writing Data to a Table
-----------------------
To write to a table, send an HTTP PUT method to the table’s URI::

	PUT <base-url>/tables/<table-name>/rows/<row-key>

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<table-name>``
     - Name of the Table to be written to
   * - ``<row-key>``
     - Row identifier

HTTP Responses
..............
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Status Codes
     - Description
   * - ``200 OK``
     - The event was successfully received and the Table was successfully written to
   * - ``400 Bad Request``
     - The JSON String map is not well-formed or cannot be parsed as a map from String to String
   * - ``404 Not Found``
     - A Table with the given name does not exist

Example
.......
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - HTTP Method
     - ``PUT <base-url>/tables/mytable/rows/status``
   * - Description
     - Write to the existing Table named *mytable* in a row identified as *status*

Comments
........
In the body of the request, you must specify the columns and values
that you want to write to the Table as a JSON String map. For example::

	{ "x":"y", "y":"a", "z":"1" }

This writes three columns named *x*, *y*, and *z* with values *y*, *a*, and *1*, respectively.

Reading Data from a Table
-------------------------
To read data from a Table, address the row that you want to read directly
in an HTTP GET method to the table’s URI::

	GET <base-url>/tables/<table-name>/rows/<row-key>[?<column-identifier>]

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<table-name>``
     - Name of the Table to be read from
   * - ``<row-key>``
     - Row identifier
   * - ``<column-identifiers>``
     - An optional combination of attributes and values such as:
       ``start=<column-id> | stop=<column-id> | columns=<column-id>,<column-id>``

HTTP Responses
..............
.. list-table::

   * - ``400 Bad Request``
     - The column list is not well-formed or cannot be parsed
   * - ``404 Not Found``
     - A Table with the given name does not exist

Example
.......
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - HTTP Method
     - ``GET <base-url>/tables/mytable/rows/status``
   * - Description
     - Read from an existing Table named *mytable*, a row identified as *status*

.. rst2pdf: PageBreak

Comments
........
The response will be a JSON String representing a map from column name to value.
For example, reading the row that was written in the `Writing Data to a Table`_, the response is::

	{"x":"y","y":"a","z":"1"}

If you are only interested in selected columns,
you can specify a list of columns explicitly or give a range of columns.

For example:

To return only columns *x* and *y*::

	GET ... /rows/<row-key>?columns=x,y

To return all columns equal to or greater than (inclusive) *c5*::

	GET ... /rows/<row-key>?start=c5

To return all columns less than (exclusive, not including) *c5*::

	GET ... /rows/<row-key>?stop=c5

To return all columns equal to or greater than (inclusive) *c2* and less than (exclusive, not including) *c5*::

	GET .../rows/<row-key>?start=c2&stop=c5

Increment Data in a Table
-------------------------
You can perform an atomic increment of cells of a Table's row, and receive back the incremented values,
by issue an HTTP POST method to the row’s URL::

	POST <base-url>/tables/<table-name>/rows/<row-key>/increment

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description

     - Description
   * - ``200 OK``
     - The event successfully incremented the row of the Table
   * - ``400 Bad Request``
     - The JSON String is not well-formed; or cannot be parsed as a map from a String to a Long;
       or one of the existing column values is not an 8-byte long value
   * - ``404 Not Found``
     - A table with the given name does not exist

Example

In the body of the method, you must specify the columns and values that you want to increment them by
as a JSON map from Strings to Long numbers, such as::

	{ "x": 1, "y": 7 }

This HTTP call has the same effect as the corresponding Java Table Increment method.

If successful, the response contains a JSON String map from the column keys to the incremented values.

For example, if the existing value of column *x* was 4, and column *y* did not exist, then the response would be::

	{"x":5,"y":7}

Column *y* is newly created.

   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<table-name>``
     - Name of the Table to be deleted from
   * - ``<row-key>``
     - Row identifier
   * - ``<column-identifiers>``
     - An optional combination of attributes and values such as::

       	start=<column-id> | stop=<column-id> | columns=<column-id>,<column-id>

........
Similarly to `Reading Data from a Table`_, explicitly list the columns that you want to delete
by adding a parameter of the form ``?columns=<column-key,...>``.
See the examples under `Reading Data from a Table`_.

Encoding of Keys and Values
---------------------------

The URLs and JSON bodies of your HTTP requests contain row keys, column keys and values,
all of which are binary byte Arrays in the Java API.

You need to encode these binary keys and values as Strings in the URL and the JSON body
(the exception is the `Increment Data in a Table`_ method, which always interprets values as long integers).

The encoding parameter of the URL specifies the encoding used in both the URL and the JSON body.

For example, if you append a parameter ``encoding=hex`` to the request URL,
then all keys and values are interpreted as hexadecimal strings,
and the returned JSON from read requests also has keys and values encoded as hexadecimal string.

Be aware that the same encoding applies to all keys and values involved in a request.

For example, suppose you incremented table *counters*, row *a*, column *x* by 42::

	POST <base-url>/tables/counters/rows/a/increment {"x":42}

Now the value of column *x* is the 8-byte number 42. If you query for the value of this column::

	GET <base-url>/tables/counters/rows/a?columns=x

The returned JSON String map will contain a non-printable string for the value of column *x*::

	{"x":"\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000*"}

Note the Unicode escapes in the string, and the asterisk at the end (which is the character at code point 42).

To make this legible, you can specify hexadecimal notation in your request;
that will require that you also encode the row key
(*a*, encoded as *61*)
and the column key (*x*, encoded as *78*) in your request as hexadecimal::

	GET <base-url>/tables/counters/rows/61?columns=78&encoding=hex

The response now contains both the column key and the value as hexadecimal strings::

	{"78":"000000000000002a"}

The supported encodings are:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Encoding
     - Description
   * - ``encoding=ascii``
     - Only ASCII characters are supported and are mapped to bytes one-to-one (Default)
   * - ``encoding=hex``
     - Hexadecimal strings. Example: the ASCII string ``a:b`` is represented as ``613A62``
   * - ``encoding=url``
     - URL encoding (also known as %-encoding or percent-encoding).
       URL-safe characters use ASCII-encoding, while other bytes values are escaped using a ``%`` sign.
       Example: the hexadecimal value ``613A62`` (ASCII string ``a:b``)
       is represented as the string ``a%3Ab``.
   * - ``encoding=base64``
     - URL-safe Base-64 encoding without padding.
       For more information, see `Internet RFC 2045 <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2045.txt>`_.
       Example: the hexadecimal value ``613A62`` is represented as the string ``YTpi``.

If you specify an encoding that is not supported, or you specify keys or values that cannot be decoded using that encoding, the request will return HTTP code ``400 Bad Request``.


Counter Values
--------------
Your Table values may frequently be counters (numbers), whereas the row and column keys might not be numbers.

In such cases, it is more convenient to represent your Table values as numeric strings,
by specifying ``counter=true``. For example::

	GET <base-url>/tables/counters/rows/a?columns=x&counter=true

The response now contains the column key as text and the row value as a numeric string::

	{"x":"42"}

Note that you can also specify the ``counter=true`` parameter when writing to a Table.
This allows you to specify values as numeric strings while using a different encoding for row and column keys.

Query HTTP API
==============

This interface supports submitting SQL queries over Datasets. Executing a query is asynchronous: 

- first, **submit** the query;
- then poll for the query's **status** until it is finished;
- once finished, retrieve the **result schema** and the **results**;
- finally, **close the query** to free the resources that it holds.

Submitting a Query
------------------
To submit a SQL query, post the query string to the ``queries`` URL::

  POST <base-url>/data/queries

The body of the request must contain a JSON string of the form::

  {
    "query": "<SQL-query-string>"
  }

where ``<SQL-query-string>`` is the actual SQL query.

HTTP Responses
..............
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Status Codes
     - Description
   * - ``200 OK``
     - The query execution was successfully initiated, and the body will contain the query-handle
       used to identify the query in subsequent requests
   * - ``400 Bad Request``
     - The query is not well-formed or contains an error, such as a nonexistent table name.

Comments
........
If the query execution was successfully initiated, the body will contain a handle 
used to identify the query in subsequent requests::

	{ "handle":"<query-handle>" }

.. rst2pdf: PageBreak

Status of a Query
-----------------
The status of a query is obtained using a HTTP GET request to the query's URL::

  GET <base-url>/data/queries/<query-handle>

HTTP Responses
..............
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Status Codes
     - Description
   * - ``200 OK``
     - The query exists and the body contains its status
   * - ``404 Not Found``
     - The query handle does not match any current query.

Comments
........
If the query exists, the body will contain the status of its execution
and whether the query has a results set::

	{
	  "status":"<status-code>",
	  "hasResults":<boolean>
	 }

Status codes include ``INITIALIZED``, ``RUNNING``, ``FINISHED``, ``CANCELED``, ``CLOSED``,
``ERROR``, ``UNKNOWN``, and ``PENDING``.


Obtaining the Result Schema
---------------------------
If the query's status is ``FINISHED`` and it has results, you can obtain the schema of the results::

  GET <base-url>/data/queries/<query-handle>/schema

HTTP Responses
..............
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Status Codes
     - Description
   * - ``200 OK``
     - The query was successfully received and the query schema was returned in the body
   * - ``404 Not Found``
     - The query handle does not match any current query

Comments
........
The query's result schema is returned in a JSON body as a list of columns,
each given by its name, type and position; if the query has no result set, this list is empty::

	[
	  {"name":"<name>", "type":"<type>", "position":<int>},
	  ...
	]

The type of each column is a data type as defined in the `Hive language manual
<https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL>`_.


Retrieving Query Results
------------------------
Query results can be retrieved in batches after the query is finished, optionally specifying the batch
size in the body of the request::

  POST <base-url>/data/queries/<query-handle>/next

The body of the request can contain a JSON string specifying the batch size::

  {
    "size":<int>
  }

If the batch size is not specified, it defaults to 20.

HTTP Responses
..............
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Status Codes
     - Description
   * - ``200 OK``
     - The event was successfully received and the result of the query was returned in the body
   * - ``404 Not Found``
     - The query handle does not match any current query

Comments
........
The results are returned in a JSON body as a list of columns,
each given as a structure containing a list of column values.::

	[
	  { "columns": [ <value_1>, <value_2>, ..., ] },
	  ...
	]

The value at each position has the type that was returned in the result schema for that position.
For example, if the returned type was ``INT``, then the value will be an integer literal,
whereas for ``STRING`` or ``VARCHAR`` the value will be a string literal.

Repeat the query to retrieve subsequent results. If all results of the query have already 
been retrieved, then the returned list is empty. 

.. rst2pdf: PageBreak

Closing a Query
---------------
The query can be closed by issuing an HTTP DELETE against its URL::

  DELETE <base-url>/data/queries/<query-handle>

This frees all resources that are held by this query.

HTTP Responses
..............
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80

     - The query was not in a state that could be closed; either wait until it is finished, or cancel it
   * - ``404 Not Found``
     - The query handle does not match any current query

Canceling a Query
-----------------
Execution of a query can be canceled before it is finished with an HTTP POST::

  POST <base-url>/data/queries/<query-handle>/cancel

After this, the query can only be closed.

**Note:** This operation is not supported with CDH 4.x distributions. It will return a
``500 Internal Server Error`` status code.

Procedure HTTP API
==================

This interface supports sending calls to the methods of an Application’s Procedures.
See the `Reactor Client HTTP API <#reactor-client-http-api>`__ for how to control the life cycle of
Procedures. 

Executing Procedures
--------------------

To call a method in an Application's Procedure, send the method name as part of the request URL
and the arguments as a JSON string in the body of the request.

The request is an HTTP POST::

	POST <base-url>/apps/<app-id>/procedures/<procedure-id>/methods/<method-id>

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<app-id>``
     - Name of the Application being called
   * - ``<procedure-id>``
     - Name of the Procedure being called
   * - ``<method-id>``
     - Name of the method being called

HTTP Responses
..............
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Status Codes
     - Description
   * - ``200 OK``
     - The event successfully called the method, and the body contains the results
   * - ``400 Bad Request``
     - The Application, Procedure and method exist, but the arguments are not as expected
   * - ``404 Not Found``
     - The Application, Procedure, or method does not exist

Reactor Client HTTP API
=======================

Use the Reactor Client HTTP API to deploy or delete Applications and manage the life cycle of 
Flows, Procedures, MapReduce jobs, Workflows, and Custom Services.

Deploy an Application
---------------------
To deploy an Application from your local file system, submit an HTTP POST request::

	POST <base-url>/apps

with the name of the JAR file as a header::

	X-Archive-Name: <JAR filename>

and its content as the body of the request::

	<JAR binary content>

Invoke the same command to update an Application to a newer version.
However, be sure to stop all of its Flows, Procedures and MapReduce jobs before updating the Application.

To list all of the deployed applications, issue an HTTP GET request::

	GET <base-url>/apps

This will return a JSON String map that lists each Application with its name and description.

Delete an Application
---------------------
To delete an Application together with all of its Flows, Procedures and MapReduce jobs, submit an HTTP DELETE::

	DELETE <base-url>/apps/<application-name>

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<application-name>``
     - Name of the Application to be deleted

Note that the ``<application-name>`` in this URL is the name of the Application 
as configured by the Application Specification,
and not necessarily the same as the name of the JAR file that was used to deploy the Application.
Note also that this does not delete the Streams and Datasets associated with the Application
because they belong to your account, not the Application.

.. rst2pdf: PageBreak

Start, Stop, Status, and Runtime Arguments
------------------------------------------
After an Application is deployed, you can start and stop its Flows, Procedures, MapReduce 
jobs, Workflows, and Custom Services, and query for their status using HTTP POST and GET methods::

	POST <base-url>/apps/<app-id>/<element-type>/<element-id>/<operation>
	GET <base-url>/apps/<app-id>/<element-type>/<element-id>/status

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<app-id>``
     - Name of the Application being called
   * - ``<element-type>``
     - One of ``flows``, ``procedures``, ``mapreduce``, ``workflows`` or ``services``
   * - ``<element-id>``
     - Name of the element (*Flow*, *Procedure*, *MapReduce*, *Workflow*, or *Custom Service*)
       being called
   * - ``<operation>``
     - One of ``start`` or ``stop``

Examples
........

.. csv-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   ,Example / Description
   **HTTP Method**, ``POST <base-url>/apps/HelloWorld/flows/WhoFlow/start``
   , Start a Flow *WhoFlow* in the Application *HelloWorld*
   **HTTP Method**, ``POST <base-url>/apps/Count/procedures/GetCounts/stop``
   , Stop the Procedure *GetCounts* in the Application *Count*
   **HTTP Method**, ``GET <base-url>/apps/HelloWorld/flows/WhoFlow/status``
   , Get the status of the Flow *WhoFlow* in the Application *HelloWorld*

.. commas above are creating spacers in the table

When starting an element, you can optionally specify runtime arguments as a JSON map in the request body::

	POST <base-url>/apps/HelloWorld/flows/WhoFlow/start

with the arguments as a JSON string in the body::

	{"foo":"bar","this":"that"}

The Continuuity Reactor will use these these runtime arguments only for this single invocation of the
element. To save the runtime arguments so that the Reactor will use them every time you start the element,
issue an HTTP PUT with the parameter ``runtimeargs``::

	PUT <base-url>/apps/HelloWorld/flows/WhoFlow/runtimeargs

with the arguments as a JSON string in the body::

	{"foo":"bar","this":"that"}

.. rst2pdf: PageBreak

To retrieve the runtime arguments saved for an Application's element, issue an HTTP GET 
request to the element's URL using the same parameter ``runtimeargs``::

	GET <base-url>/apps/HelloWorld/flows/WhoFlow/runtimeargs

This will return the saved runtime arguments in JSON format.

Container Information
---------------------

To find out the address of an element's container host and the container’s debug port, you can query
the Reactor for a Procedure, Flow or Service’s live info via an HTTP GET method::

	GET <base-url>/apps/<app-id>/<element-type>/<element-id>/live-info

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<app-id>``
     - Name of the Application being called
   * - ``<element-type>``
     - One of ``flows``, ``procedures`` or ``services``
   * - ``<element-id>``
     - Name of the element (*Flow*, *Procedure* or *Custom Service*)

Example::

	GET <base-url>/apps/WordCount/flows/WordCounter/live-info

The response is formatted in JSON; an example of this is shown in:

Run History and Schedule
------------------------

To see the history of all runs of selected elements (Flows, Procedures, MapReduce jobs, Workflows, and
Services), issue an HTTP GET to the element’s URL with the ``history`` parameter.
This will return a JSON list of all completed runs, each with a start time,
end time and termination status::

	GET <base-url>/apps/<app-id>/<element>/<element-id>/history

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<app-id>``
     - Name of the Application
   * - ``<element-type>``
     - One of ``flows``, ``procedures``, ``mapreduce``, ``workflows`` or ``services``
   * - ``<element-id>``
     - Name of the element

Example
.......
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - HTTP Method
     - ``GET <base-url>/apps/HelloWorld/flows/WhoFlow/history``
   * - Description
     - Retrieve the history of the Flow *WhoFlow* of the Application *HelloWorld*
   * - Returns
     - ``{"runid":"...","start":1382567447,"end":1382567492,"status":"STOPPED"},``
       ``{"runid":"...","start":1382567383,"end":1382567397,"status":"STOPPED"}``

The *runid* field is a UUID that uniquely identifies a run within the Continuuity Reactor,
with the start and end times in seconds since the start of the Epoch (midnight 1/1/1970).

For Services, you can retrieve the history of a Twill Service using::

  GET <base-url>/apps/<app-id>/services/<service-id>/history

Example
.......
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - HTTP Method

   * - Returns
     - ``{"runid":"...","start":1382567447,"end":1382567492,"status":"STOPPED"},``
       ``{"runid":"...","start":1382567383,"end":1382567397,"status":"STOPPED"}``

For Workflows, you can also retrieve:

- the schedules defined for a workflow (using the parameter ``schedules``)::

Promote
-------
To promote an Application from your local Continuuity Reactor to your Sandbox Continuuity Reactor,
send a POST request with the host name of your Sandbox in the request body.
You must include the API key for the Sandbox in the request header.

Example
.......
Promote the Application *HelloWorld* from your Local Reactor to your Sandbox::

	POST <base-url>/apps/HelloWorld/promote

with the API Key in the header::

	X-Continuuity-ApiKey: <api-key> {"hostname":"<sandbox>.continuuity.net"}

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<api-key>``
     - Continuuity Reactor API key, obtained from an account at
       `Continuuity Accounts <http://accounts.continuuity.com>`_
   * - ``<sandbox>``
     - Sandbox located on ``continuuity.net``


Logging HTTP API
=================

Downloading Logs
----------------
You can download the logs that are emitted by any of the *Flows*, *Procedures*, *MapReduce* jobs,
or *Services* running in the Continuuity Reactor. To do that, send an HTTP GET request::

	GET <base-url>/apps/<app-id>/<element-type>/<element-id>/logs?start=<ts>&stop=<ts>

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<app-id>``
     - Name of the Application being called
   * - ``<element-type>``
     - One of ``flows``, ``procedures``, ``mapreduce``, or ``services``
   * - ``<element-id>``
     - Name of the element (*Flow*, *Procedure*, *MapReduce* job, *Service*) being called
   * - ``<ts>``
     - *Start* and *stop* times, given as seconds since the start of the Epoch.

Example
.......
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - HTTP Method
     - ``GET <base-url>/apps/CountTokens/flows/CountTokensFlow/``
       ``logs?start=1382576400&stop=1382576700``
   * - Description
     - Return the logs for all the events from the Flow *CountTokensFlow* of the *CountTokens*
       Application,
       beginning ``Thu, 24 Oct 2013 01:00:00 GMT`` and
       ending ``Thu, 24 Oct 2013 01:05:00 GMT`` (five minutes later)

Comments
........
The output is formatted as HTML-embeddable text; that is, characters that have a special meaning in HTML will be escaped. A line of the log may look like this::

	2013-10-23 18:03:09,793 - INFO [FlowletProcessDriver-source-0-
        executor:c.c.e.c.StreamSource@-1] – source: Emitting line: this is an &amp; character

Note how the context of the log line shows the name of the Flowlet (*source*), its instance number (0) as well as the original line in the Application code. The character *&* is escaped as ``&amp;``; if you don’t desire this escaping, you can turn it off by adding the parameter ``&escape=false`` to the request URL.


Metrics HTTP API
================
As Applications process data, the Continuuity Reactor collects metrics about the Application’s behavior and performance. Some of these metrics are the same for every Application—how many events are processed, how many data operations are performed, etc.—and are thus called system or Reactor metrics.

Other metrics are user-defined and differ from Application to Application. 
For details on how to add metrics to your Application, see the section on User-Defined Metrics in the
the Developer Guide:

Metrics Requests
----------------
The general form of a metrics request is::

	GET <base-url>/metrics/<scope>/<context>/<metric>?<time-range>

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``<scope>``
     - Either ``reactor`` (system metrics) or ``user`` (user-defined metrics)
   * - ``<context>``
     - Hierarchy of context; see `Available Contexts`_
   * - ``<metric>``
     - Metric being queried; see `Available Metrics`_
   * - ``<time-range>``
     - A `Time Range`_ or ``aggregate=true`` for all since the Application was deployed

Examples
........
.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - HTTP Method
     - ``GET <base-url>/metrics/reactor/apps/HelloWorld/flows/``
       ``WhoFlow/flowlets/saver/process.bytes?aggregate=true``
   * - Description

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :stub-columns: 1

   * - HTTP Method

       ``WhoService/runnables/WhoRun/names.bytes?aggregate=true``
   * - Description
     - Using a *User-Defined* metric, *names.bytes* in a Service's Twill Runnable

Comments
........
The scope must be either ``reactor`` for system metrics or ``user`` for user-defined metrics.

System metrics are either Application metrics (about Applications and their Flows, Procedures, MapReduce and Workflows) or they are Data metrics (relating to Streams or Datasets).

User metrics are always in the Application context.

For example, to retrieve the number of input data objects (“events”) processed by a Flowlet named *splitter*, in the Flow *CountRandomFlow* of the Application *CountRandom*, over the last 5 seconds, you can issue an HTTP GET method::

	GET <base-url>/metrics/reactor/apps/CountRandom/flows/CountRandomFlow/flowlets/
          splitter/process.events?start=now-5s&count=5

This returns a JSON response that has one entry for every second in the requested time interval. It will have values only for the times where the metric was actually emitted (shown here "pretty-printed", unlike the actual responses)::

	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	Content-Type: application/json
	{"start":1382637108,"end":1382637112,"data":[
	{"time":1382637108,"value":6868},
	{"time":1382637109,"value":6895},
	{"time":1382637110,"value":6856},
	{"time":1382637111,"value":6816},
	{"time":1382637112,"value":6765}]}

If you want the number of input objects processed across all Flowlets of a Flow, you address the metrics API at the Flow context::

	GET <base-url>/metrics/reactor/apps/CountRandom/flows/
		CountRandomFlow/process.events?start=now-5s&count=5

Similarly, you can address the context of all flows of an Application, an entire Application, or the entire Reactor::

	GET <base-url>/metrics/reactor/apps/CountRandom/
		flows/process.events?start=now-5s&count=5
	GET <base-url>/metrics/reactor/apps/CountRandom/
		process.events?start=now-5s&count=5
	GET <base-url>/metrics/reactor/process.events?start=now-5s&count=5

To request user-defined metrics instead of system metrics, specify ``user`` instead of ``reactor`` in the URL
and specify the user-defined metric at the end of the request.

For example, to request a user-defined metric for the *HelloWorld* Application's *WhoFlow* Flow::

	GET <base-url>/metrics/user/apps/HelloWorld/flows/
		WhoFlow/flowlets/saver/names.bytes?aggregate=true

To retrieve multiple metrics at once, instead of a GET, issue an HTTP POST, with a JSON list as the request body that enumerates the name and attributes for each metrics. For example::

	POST <base-url>/metrics

with the arguments as a JSON string in the body::

	Content-Type: application/json
	[ "/reactor/collect.events?aggregate=true",
	"/reactor/apps/HelloWorld/process.events?start=1380323712&count=6000" ]

If the context of the requested metric or metric itself doesn't exist the system returns status 200 (OK) with JSON formed as per above description and with values being zeroes.

Time Range
----------
The time range of a metric query can be specified in various ways:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Time Range
     - Description
   * - ``start=now-30s&end=now``
     - The last 30 seconds. The begin time is given in seconds relative to the current time.
       You can apply simple math, using ``now`` for the current time, 
       ``s`` for seconds, ``m`` for minutes, ``h`` for hours and ``d`` for days. 
       For example: ``now-5d-12h`` is 5 days and 12 hours ago.
   * - ``start=1385625600&`` ``end=1385629200``
     - From ``Thu, 28 Nov 2013 08:00:00 GMT`` to ``Thu, 28 Nov 2013 09:00:00 GMT``,
       both given as since the start of the Epoch
   * - ``start=1385625600&`` ``count=3600``
     - The same as before, but with the count given as a number of seconds

Instead of getting the values for each second of a time range, you can also retrieve the
aggregate of a metric over time. The following request will return the total number of input objects processed since the Application *CountRandom* was deployed, assuming that the Reactor has not been stopped or restarted (you cannot specify a time range for aggregates)::

	GET <base-url>/metrics/reactor/apps/CountRandom/process.events?aggregate=true

.. rst2pdf: PageBreak

Available Contexts
------------------
The context of a metric is typically enclosed into a hierarchy of contexts. For example, the Flowlet context is enclosed in the Flow context, which in turn is enclosed in the Application context. A metric can always be queried (and aggregated) relative to any enclosing context. These are the available Application contexts of the Continuuity Reactor:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - System Metric
     - Context
   * - One Flowlet of a Flow
     - ``/apps/<app-id>/flows/<flow-id>/flowlets/<flowlet-id>``
   * - All Flowlets of a Flow
     - ``/apps/<app-id>/flows/<flow-id>``
   * - All Flowlets of all Flows of an Application
     - ``/apps/<app-id>/flows``
   * - One Procedure
     - ``/apps/<app-id>/procedures/<procedure-id>``
   * - All Procedures of an Application
     - ``/apps/<app-id>/procedures``

   * - One MapReduce
     - ``/apps/<app-id>/mapreduce/<mapreduce-id>``
   * - All MapReduce of an Application
     - ``/apps/<app-id>/mapreduce``
   * - One Twill Runnable
     - ``/apps/<app-id>/services/<service-id>/runnables/<runnable-id>``
   * - One Service
     - ``/apps/<app-id>/services/<service-id>``
   * - All Services of an Application
     - ``/apps/<app-id>/services``
   * - All elements of an Application
     - ``/apps/<app-id>``
   * - All elements of all Applications
     - ``/``

Stream metrics are only available at the Stream level and the only available context is:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Stream Metric
     - Context
   * - A single Stream
     - ``/streams/<stream-id>``

.. rst2pdf: PageBreak

Dataset metrics are available at the Dataset level, but they can also be queried down to the
Flowlet, Procedure, Mapper, or Reducer level:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

   * - Dataset Metric
     - Context
   * - A single Dataset in the context of a single Flowlet
     - ``/datasets/<dataset-id>/apps/<app-id>/flows/``
       ``<flow-id>/flowlets/<flowlet-id>``
   * - A single Dataset in the context of a single Flow
     - ``/datasets/<dataset-id>/apps/<app-id>/flows/<flow-id>``
   * - A single Dataset in the context of a specific Application
     - ``/datasets/<dataset-id>/<any application context>``
   * - A single Dataset across all Applications
     - ``/datasets/<dataset-id>``
   * - All Datasets across all Applications
     - ``/``
