In this page, we explore various concepts behind Loom administration and explain various tools used in Loom for
administrators to configure and manage their clusters. At the core of a Loom cluster is the notion of a **Template**, which 
is the blueprint or the primordial stuff of what Loom clusters are comprised ofâ€”it is the essence or the DNA of how different 
parts and components come together to materialize into a cluster.

Concepts
========

As mentioned above, Loom works through the use of **Templates**, which dictate the configuration of the
clusters that users can spin up. An administrator can specify any number of such templates to put into
their **Catalog** for users. 

Several concepts central to cluster configuration are definable in Loom. These aspects are:

* **Providers** - Infrastructure providers (such as Amazon or OpenStack) that supply machines.

* **Hardware types** - Type of hardware (such as small, medium, or large) that can be used for the nodes of a cluster. 

* **Image types** - Basic disk images installed on the nodes of a cluster.

* **Services** - Bundled software services that can be placed on a cluster.

* **Cluster Template** - Blueprint describing show hardware, images, and services should be laid out to form a cluster.

Templates are defined by specifying hardware types, image types, and services that can be used in a cluster, as well
as a set of constraints that describes how those hardware types, image types, and services should be laid out in a cluster.
Template creation can be done in 
two ways: 1) :doc:`Admin UI </guide/admin/ui>` and 2) :doc:`Web Services REST Cluster API</rest/templates>`. 

Because the notion of **Templates** is central to the Loom cluster creation, please read the :doc:`Web Services REST Cluster 
API</rest/templates>` or :doc:`Admin UI </guide/admin/ui>` carefully to design templates that meet your needs.

Tools
=====
Loom includes several tools for administrators to simplify their administrative tasks. Apart from the
:doc:`Admin UI </guide/admin/ui>`, Loom provides several additional :doc:`metrics and monitoring </guide/admin/monitoring>` tools.
Loom allows administrators to :doc:`configure their servers </guide/admin/server-config>`
and  :doc:`write custom plugins </guide/admin/plugins>` for allocating machines with your providers or to implement custom services.
Administrators who are more command line driven, or who wish to write quick administrative scripts,
can employ the :doc:`Web services API </rest/index>`.

Please refer to the following pages for more details:

        * :doc:`Administration User Interface </guide/admin/ui>`

        * :doc:`Server Configuration </guide/admin/server-config>`

        * :doc:`Monitoring and Metrics </guide/admin/monitoring>`

        * :doc:`Macros </guide/admin/macros>`

        * :doc:`Provisioner Plugins </guide/admin/plugins>`

        * :doc:`REST Web Service Interface </rest/index>`
